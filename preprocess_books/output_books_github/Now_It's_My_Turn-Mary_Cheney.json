    "text": " Mary Cheney writes about her experience as a campaign staffer during the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, when she worked for her father, Dick Cheney. She recounts what she learned in 2000 about campaign staffers's job, laying out pointers. Moving on to the re-election of 2004, she expresses her repudiation of the Marriage Protection Act supported by George W. Bush. As openly lesbian, she considered leaving the campaign; she only stayed because she believed George W. Bush to be the best commander-in-chief during the War on Terror. She also expresses outrage at the way John Kerry's campaign made use of her personal life when the issue of same-sex marriage came up."
