    "text": " One day an enormous crocodile goes tramping through the forest telling all the animals he's going to eat children. The animals tell him that it's a horrible thing to do but he tries to use his tricks to eat the tasty children nonetheless. However, every time he tries, the animals of the forest save the children. Later on, Trunky the elephant kills the crocodile by swinging him around in the air by his tail and letting him go until he flies into the sky and crashes headlong into the Sun. It is in the style of a picture book in contrast to Dahl's other books, illustrated by Quentin Blake. It was first published in 1978. A TV series based on the book is expected to come out sometime in 2012."
