    "text": " A series of stories which explores relationships between people of Mexico and the United States. Large parts of the USA were once part of Mexico, all the way from California to Texas, and so the Mexican people feel a special connection with that area. Both countries depend on each other for trade and culture, and many people divide their time and their lives between both sides of the border. In the second story a Mexican student goes to medical school in New York state, where he finds that people there know nothing about the conditions in Mexico, but feel ready to make judgements."
