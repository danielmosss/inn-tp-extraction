    "text": " Pearl Andreas, Ruby Landry's daughter, is graduating high school and goes to an apprenticeship at a hospital. There, Jack Weller invites her to his house (\"to study\") and tries to seduce her, saying she is \"frigid\". Pearl leaves, but begins to wonder about what he said. Whilst Ruby is at Pearl's graduation party, her friend Nina dies. Nina sends a message for Ruby to hurry, but Ruby stays for the rest of the party. When she does get there, Nina is already dead. Soon after, one of Pearl's little brothers, Jean, dies from a snakebite. His twin, Pierre, become catatonic with grief, Beau begins to drink, and Ruby, thinking that this happened because she did not go to Nina when she was asked, flees to where she grew up- the bayou. Pearl follows her there, and while there looking for her, begins a relationship with Jack Clovis. Pearl is kidnapped by Buster Trahaw, to whom Grandpere Jack promised Ruby many years ago. Pearl escapes, and when Buster tries to follow her he is eaten by alligators. Eventually Pearl and Jack find Ruby, who practices a vodoo ritual. Ruby and Pearl return to New Orleans, and Pierre eventually comes out of his catatonic state. Pearl keeps up her relationship with Jack Clovis."
