    "text": " Professor Bullfinch has created a radio telescope (\"dish\") for the government which will try to determine if extraterrestrials are trying to contact Earth. When Danny sneaks into the observatory, he hears non-random sounds coming from space. He then must figure out how to translate the sounds. The observatory described in the book is similar to the real life SETI project which Carl Sagan would also use later in his novel Contact."
