    "text": " The book consists of an introduction and three chapters, each featuring passages from her diary. The first chapter, 'The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action' is a speech first given on December 28, 1977 at the Lesbian and Literature Panel of the Modern Language Association. Starting with an excerpt from The Black Unicorn, Lorde calls on the reader to relinquish silence and speak out. The second chapter, 'Breast Cancer: A Black Lesbian Feminist Experience', is a day-to-day account of her cancer experience, from biopsy to mastectomy. Lorde focuses on the importance of the love received from the women around her throughout her experience. She also harbours her solace at talking about it with other lesbian cancer survivors. Further, she mentions her refusal to wear a silicon breast after the operation. In the third chapter, 'Breast Cancer: Power vs. Prosthesis', Lorde dwells on her coming to terms with the outcome of the operation, with one breast. She explains that although it would be fine for women to resort to a prosthesis if they wanted to, it seems like a cover-up in a society where women are solely judged on their looks. She also harbours the possibilities of alternative medicine, arguing that women should look at all the options."
