    "text": " In the rodent-populated city of Pinchester lives Hermux Tantamoq, a watchmaker. When the beautiful adventuress and aviatrix Linka Perflinger drops into his shop to have him fix her watch, Hermux instantly falls in love. Then a shady-looking rat comes to pick up the watch instead... and with a little investigating, Hermux is head over heels into a mystery involving curious kidnappings, murders, and the formula of Eternal Youth, while Dr. Mennus tries to stop Hermux to get the bottle of eternal youth."
