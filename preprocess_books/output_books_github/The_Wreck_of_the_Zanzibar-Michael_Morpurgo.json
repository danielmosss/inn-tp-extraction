It seems there's little hope... that is until the Zanzibar is wrecked on the island's rocks and everything changes.\" The book is presented as a diary written by a young girl on a small island off the coast of Cornwall, where the Atlantic meets the English Channel. The area is subjected to severe storms, one of which destroys the island's buildings and kills the livestock; many families are left hungry and plan to leave the island. However, the residents rescue the crew of the ship Zanzibar when it runs aground, and this is the catalyst that brings new life to the island.
