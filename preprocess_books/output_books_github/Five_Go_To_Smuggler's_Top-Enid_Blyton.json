    "text": " The Five are happily staying at Kirrin Cottage for the holidays until the big ash tree in the garden falls down and destroys the top floor where the bedrooms are. Uncle Quentin's scientist friend,Mr Lenoir, was coming to stay over but now as he can't, he invites the five to his house. Mr Lenoir's stepson Sooty is a friend of Julian and Dick. George finds out that she can't take Timmy her dog and at first refuses to go, but then decides to go and take Timmy, but hide him in secret! So they go to Sooty Lenoir's house, Smugglers Top while Kirrin Cottage is being repaired. Smugglers Top is situated on a hill named Castaway Hill. The children come to know that there is a network of secret passages inside the hill and that there are secret doors in the house which open into these passages. One night, the boys wake up and find someone flashing lights as some sort of signal from one of the towers at Smuggler's Top. The children are puzzled at this mysterious discovery. After a few days, Uncle Quentin also visits Smugglers Top to stay for a few days. But one night, quite unexpectedly, Uncle Quentin and Sooty disappear. The children are sure that they have been kidnapped. There are many suspects. It might be the butler Block who appears to be stone deaf or Mr Barling,who is a rich man and a suspected smuggler. The five even suspect Sooty's father, Mr Lenior! They hunt underground in the honeycomb of passages for Uncle Quentin and Sooty, with the help of Timmy the dog. Can they solve the mystery and find Uncle Quentin and Sooty before they get lost in the passages?"
