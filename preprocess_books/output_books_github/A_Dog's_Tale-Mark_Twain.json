    "text": " The book is told from the standpoint of a loyal household pet, a dog self described by the first sentence of the story; \"My father was a St. Bernard, my mother was a collie, but I am a Presbyterian.\" The story begins with a description of the dog's life as a puppy and her separation from her mother, which to her was inexplicable. Her puppy and her owner's new child were soon added to her new home. When a fire breaks out in the nursery, the dog risks her life to drag the baby to safety. In the process, her motives are misunderstood and she is cruelly beaten. Soon however, the truth of the situation is discovered and she receives no end of praise. Later in the story, her puppy dies as a result of the owner's biological experiments. Only a servant seems to realize the irony, exclaiming, \"Poor little doggie, you saved HIS child!\" In the end, the dog pines inconsolable over the grave of the puppy with the clear implication that she will do so until death."
