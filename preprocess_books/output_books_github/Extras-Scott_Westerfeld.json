    "text": " Three years after the events of Specials freed the world from the pretty lesions which forced them to be obedient, society is beginning to settle into a new form. Each city has been forced to find a way of dealing with the new pressure on its resources, caused by the freed creativity of the inhabitants. In Japan, one city has chosen a \"reputation economy\", rewarding citizens either with merits for productive tasks which help the city, or with face rank, a measure of popularity. Every inhabitant has their own feed and obsessively tracks their face rank, hoping to gain fame and lose their status as an \"extra\". Aya Fuse tries to win fame as a \"kicker\", or amateur journalist, filming stories with her modified hovercam Moggle and posting them for the city to see."
