    "text": " Meeting his father's multizillionaire boss inspires ten-year-old Lee to come up with a brilliant get-rich-quick scheme of his own. But not everyone is keen for Lee to succeed. Local shopkeeper Panface certainly is not, and it seems that he has sneaky spies out there, trying to ruin Lee's plans Will Lee overcome those out to stop him making his fortune? Or will he spend the whole time daydreaming about how many houses he will own and how many butlers he will have? Lee will need to rely on his common sense and financial genius if he is to succeed . . . so it could be a struggle."
