    "text": " Serge follows the suitcase containing five million up the coast of Florida to Tampa where he proceeds to meet Lenny Lipowicz, a part time Don Johnson impersonator who owns a real moon rock from a 1970s space mission. Along for the ride are City and Country, two girls from Alabama who are on the run after an incident in a bar bathroom where a girl accidentally stabbed herself with a steak knife she was using to snort cocaine from. One of the girls pulled the blade out trying to help, but it cut an artery. With their fingerprints all over, they decided to run for it. There is also a gangster named Fiddlebottom who changed his name to the more menacing \"Zargoza\", and a Hemingway impersonator named Jethro, and so on. All these characters meet up by the end at the Hammerhead Ranch Motel as hurricane Rolando-berto comes ashore."
