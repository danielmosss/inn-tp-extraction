    "text": " The novel is the story of Jamie Towfeek, a teenager living in Sydney's western suburbs. Jamie wants to be the real thing. From the roots of her dyed blonde hair... There are a lot of things Jamie hates about her life: her dark hair, her dad's Stone Age Charter of Curfew Rights, her real name - Jamilah Towfeek. For the past three years, Jamie has hidden her Lebanese/Muslim background from everyone at school. It's only with her email friend John that she can really be herself. But now life is getting more complicated. The most popular boy in school is interested in her, but there's no way he would be if he knew the truth. Then there's Timothy the school loner, who for some reason Jamie just can't stop thinking about. As for John, he seems to have a pretty big secret of his own. To top it all off, Jamie's school formal is coming up. And her band at her Muslim school is performing at the formal. The only way she'll be allowed to attend is by revealing her true identity. But who is she ... Jamie or Jamilah? Various other stories also happen in this book. Her older sister Shereen is a human rights and anti-war protester, and their father wants her to settle down. She gets closer to her friend Amy, and tries to find the reason why she has suddenly become more secretive to her. She is the first person she tells that she is a Muslim and at the end, the two become best friends, and leave their other friend, Liz behind with the other discriminatory students at school."
