    "text": " Camilla is facing significant problems at home. Her mother, Rose, has begun an affair with a man named Jacques. Her mother begs Camilla to keep it a secret, while Camilla's father, Rafferty, asks her to be honest and tell him the truth. Camilla is torn between her loyalty to both parents and begins to realize they are very imperfect people. To cope with the struggle, Camilla befriends Frank, her best friend's older brother. He is understanding of her problems and assists her in accepting her parents flaws. Frank encourages Camilla to define herself not by her family but to define herself as who she truly is. The pair share ideas on life, religion and philosophy and begin to form a romantic attachment. Their happiness is cut short when their families problems get worse. Frank's parents break up and he is forced to suddenly move away with his father. Camilla's parents decide to work on their marriage and go on a European Vacation together. Unfortunately, while her parents are traveling, Camilla is going to be sent to a Swiss boarding school. While Camilla is heartbroken by the loss of Frank, she uses the inner strength she has gained in the past weeks to deal with the changes in her life."
