    "text": " In A Race Against Time, Nancy Drew is a movie star? Ned's college film club is making a spooky vampire movie set in an old deserted mansion - and Nancy is the star! The popular detective has also been asked to model in a series of TV commercials for a new beauty product. As if that weren't enough to keep Nancy busy, she has a couple of cases to solve. A valuable racehorse has been stolen from a nearby farm. It is up to Nancy to figure out which of its owner's many enemies may have taken the prize thoroughbred. There's also another mystery around. Someone keeps disturbing the film club as they are shooting their film. When a building goes up in flames, it is time to take the disruption seriously! Nancy has two deadlines to beat - to return the missing horse before its big race and to help Ned and his friends finish their horror film - before some mysterious force ruins everything!"
