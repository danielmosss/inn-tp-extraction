    "text": " Mela, like all merpeople, is able to turn into a full human so that she can walk on land. To follow \"landbound custom\", she finds clothing and shoes (conveniently growing on trees, as is common on Xanth). Of particular concern is which panties to choose - after all, there is significant interest in the color of her panties. After trying on dozens of pairs, Mela finally decides on plaid (the color she would choose was the subject of an Impossible Question that the Deamon X(A/N)th asked the Good Magician Humprey in Question Quest). Gwenny has to prove her courage to become leader of Goblin Mountain. Her task is to steal an egg from the Roc's nest. The two storylines are brought together when Mela has to help save Gwenny from a Roc and a hard place. pl:Barwa jej bielizny"
