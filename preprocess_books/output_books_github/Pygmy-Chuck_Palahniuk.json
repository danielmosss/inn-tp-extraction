    "text": " The plot revolves around a 13-year-old boy named Agent Number 67 from an unnamed, totalitarian state described as a \"mash-up of North Korea, Cuba, Communist-era China, and Nazi-era Germany\", as an exchange student to live with an American family from an unnamed Midwestern location as a sleeper agent to execute a terrorist attack on the United States codenamed \"Operation Havoc\". Nicknamed \"Pygmy\" by his American family for his diminutive size, he is introduced into the rituals of modern American life such as enrolling in public school, and going to church. On a trip to Wal-Mart with his host brother, in the bathroom he sodomises a bully who had been victimising his host brother. The scene is described in graphic detail. This is only the first of many acts committed by the operative in order to adjust to American life, while preparing with his fellow operatives, also masquerading as exchange students, to execute \"Operation Havoc\"."
