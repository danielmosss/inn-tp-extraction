    "text": " Joseph is a young boy who joins his father in a mind reading act. When a girl named Cassandra, who actually does have second sight, moves into his boarding house, she confesses to Joseph that she is having visions of something terrible happening to President Abraham Lincoln. Meanwhile, Joseph befriends John Wilkes Booth, an actor who is appearing in a local production. Cassandra moves with her uncle to boarding house run by Mary Surratt, where they meet David Herold. As the Civil War ends and Cassandra's visions of Lincoln's approaching death grow stronger, Joseph and Cassandra have to prove to the authorities that Booth is planning to kill Lincoln before it is too late."
