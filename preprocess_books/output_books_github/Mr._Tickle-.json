    "text": " Mr. Tickle's story begins with him in bed and making himself breakfast without getting up because of his \"extraordinarily long arms\". He then decides that it is a tickling sort of day and so goes around town tickling people - a teacher, a policeman, a greengrocer, a station guard, a doctor, a butcher and a postman. The book ends with a warning that Mr. Tickle could be lurking around your doorway, waiting to tickle you."
