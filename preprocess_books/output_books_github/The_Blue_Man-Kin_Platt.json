    "text": " Steve Forrester is a teenager who goes to live for a summer with his aunt and uncle, who run a rural motel. On his first day running the desk by himself, a strange man checks in, dressed in a scarf, hat, trench coat and gloves, unusual attire for summer. The light on the desk starts to flicker as the man signs in with an illegible scrawl. Later, Steve brings a towel to the stranger's room and sees something that launches him on an unusual and singular adventure: the man's skin is bright blue and he seems to be draining energy from a nearby lamp. After his uncle is seemingly murdered by the fleeing Blue Man, (who appears to possibly be of alien origin), Steve sets out on a cross-country search for justice and revenge."
