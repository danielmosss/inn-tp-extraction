    "text": " It tells the story of seven young people in three different families who form an amateur theatrical group, the Blue Door Theatre Company. The children write, produce, direct and act in their own plays, each of them harnessing a particular talent. Nigel designs scenery, for example; Jeremy composes music; while Sandra makes costumes. During the course of the book, each of the young people realises a particular ambition. It is \"Bulldog\", who shines in comic roles, who realises his ambition to create the elusive \"swish of the curtain\". At the book's climax, the \"Blue Doors\" enter a drama contest which they have to win in order to be allowed to attend dramatic school to realise their dream of a career in the professional theatre."
