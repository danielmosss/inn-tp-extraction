    "text": " The novel begins with the introduction of \"Lee,\" who recounts his life in Mexico City among an American expatriate college students and bar owners surviving on part-time jobs and GI Bill benefits. The novel is written in the third-person and Burroughs commented in the \"Introduction\" published in 1985, that it represents him off heroin, whereas in Junkie, his narrator was psychologically \"protected\" by his addiction. Lee is self-conscious, insecure, and driven to pursue a young man named Allerton, who is based on Adelbert Lewis Marker (1930-1998), a recently discharged American Navy serviceman from Jacksonville, Florida who befriended Burroughs in Mexico City."
