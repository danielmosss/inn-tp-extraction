    "text": " Seventeen year old jester Sebastian Darke, travels to the opulent city of Keladon in an attempt to fill his late father, Alexander's, shoes and become a proper jester, and therefore save himself and his mother from poverty. Upon his journey, Sebastian meets the halfling warrior Cornelius Drummel, and by chance rescued the beautiful - and feisty - Princess Kerin, Keladon's future queen from a group of Brigands. However, when Sebastian, Cornelius and Sebastian's ill-tempered buffalope, Max, arrive in Keladon, they become entangled in the dastardly King Septimus's plot to do away with his niece, Princess Kerin, and ensure he remains king forever."
