    "text": " Elsa is a bright and lively young girl who has dreams to become a comedienne. When her stepfather loses his job, her family, including her baby half-brother Hank and half-sister Pippa, are forced to move into a rundown bed and breakfast hotel that is used as accommodation for poor families. She doesn't get along with her stepfather, as he often loses his temper with her and hits her, so takes to spending time with her friend Naomi, with her little sister usually tagging along. Eventually her mother makes her attend the nearby school. Elsa has a hard time adjusting to the new circumstances and doesn't enjoy her new school, as she is behind in lessons so has to take extra classes. She frequently plays truant from school with boys from the hotel. One night Elsa awakes to the smell of smoke, and upon investigating she discovers the hotel kitchen is on fire. Using her loud voice, she runs from to door to door, yelling to wake up all the residents. Everyone in the hotel makes it out safely, and Elsa has a chance to appear on television when a news reporter asks her how she woke up everyone up. As much of the hotel is damaged, Elsa's family and many others are given temporary accommodation in a much nicer hotel. Elsa finally has a chance to star on television when she is invited on a programme about courageous children."
