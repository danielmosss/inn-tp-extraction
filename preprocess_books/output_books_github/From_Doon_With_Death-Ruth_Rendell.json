    "text": " The police knew all about Margaret Parsons. She was a religious, old-fashioned and respectable woman, as unexciting and dependable as her marriage. But it wasn't her life that interested Wexford - it was her violent, passionate death. Inspector Wexford becomes interested in her death after finding a number of letters from the mysterious Doon."
