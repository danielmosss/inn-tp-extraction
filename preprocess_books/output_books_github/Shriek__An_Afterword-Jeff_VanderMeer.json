    "text": " Ambergris, named for \"the most secret and valued part of the whale,\" is a fantastical urban milieu, explicitly modern and apparently pre-industrial (despite the presence of guns, bombs, and motor vehicles). Ambergris is characterized by grocery stores, post offices, caf√©s, and vendors (The \"Borges Bookstore\" bears note). The city was built over the land (and quiet protests) of the fungally-adept \"graycaps,\" humanoids of uncertain disposition. The inhabitants of Ambergris enjoy a fascination with squid, and celebrate an anarchic annual Festival of the Freshwater Squid."
