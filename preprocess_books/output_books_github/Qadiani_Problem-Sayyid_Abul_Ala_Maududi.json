    "text": " The book deals with some of the interpretations of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. It discusses the finality of prophethood, the prophethood of Ahmad, and its consequences in Muslim society. It also mentions the status of the Ahmadiyya Community and its political plans. In one of the appendices of the book, a discussion between Allama Iqbal and Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru is reproduced, in which Allama Iqbal has expressed his views regarding followers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad and have rationalized his view that followers of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad be given a status of a different religious community in India."
