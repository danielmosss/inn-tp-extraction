    "text": " On the post-nuclear landscape of the United States, it is hard to survive. The most ruthless individuals are dragons, who reject their own humanity, as well as the notion of kindness. Those who survived in underground bunkers don't like to visit the surface because life there is so brutal. However, the protagonist knows of an automated missile base that is programmed to perform a delayed nuclear strike &mdash; delayed to twenty years after the War, a time that is quickly approaching. Mike, a man from \"Reserv-6\", meets Drago, a \"dragon\" who can communicate telepathically with his dog, Prince. As the three journey to stop the missile &mdash; aimed at Russia &mdash; from launching, Drago learns much about himself that he didn't know, and, by the end, questions his status as a dragon altogether."
