    "text": " The story takes place in a place called Rabbit Hill, a country crossroads near Danbury, Connecticut. The animal inhabitants are suffering as the house nearby has been abandoned for several years and the untended gardens, the animals' source of food, have withered to nothing. Then \"New Folks\" move in to the house. Are the New Folks hunters, or friendly gardeners who will share their crops with the animals?"
