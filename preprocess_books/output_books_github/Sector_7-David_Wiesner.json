    "text": " The story is set at the observatory of the Empire State Building where a class of school children are on a field trip. The primary character is a boy befriended by a cloud and whisked away to Sector 7, the depot for clouds. There the boy proceeds to produce new blueprints of fantastic shapes for the disgruntled group of young clouds. As the young clouds experiment, they delight in their new forms as ocean creatures. The adults running the cloud depot are furious when they discover of the young clouds' misbehavior, so escort the boy back to the observatory with his cloud friend. Once the drawings are examined further by the adults they begin to admire the possibilities. As the children return on the school bus, the New York skyline is filled with a profusion of clouds in the shapes of aquarium fish and ocean creatures."
