    "text": " The story details the events surrounding an aboriginal family living in southwest Queensland, Australia. The story centers around Dougy and his sister Gracey, who has been selected for the State 100m running championships. The story opens with a flashback to a picture in Dougy's past of him and his family sitting by the riverbank in their town drinking. Dougy spends most of this time monologuing about his family and when a flood comes they have to try to escape."
