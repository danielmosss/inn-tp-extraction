    "text": " This novel does little to expand on Flinx’s much hinted at upcoming importance in fighting a great evil approaching the Humanx Commonwealth, but does show Foster’s love of travel to the tropical portions of our world. Midworld is essentially a worldwide jungle that is many more times deadly than our own. His stance on environmentalism comes through in how most of the villains are defeated not so much by Flinx's skills or cleverness, but by their lack of respect for the world itself. The events aren’t so much important in and of themselves but seek to expand on Flinx’s talents and set up the next book in the series."
