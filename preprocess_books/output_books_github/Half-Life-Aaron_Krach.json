    "text": " Two weeks before high school graduation and the geography of 18 year-old Adam Westman's life is about to change dramatically. Many of the familiar landmarks will remainâ€”his best friend Dart riding shotgun; the suburban house where he lives with his dad and younger sister; and the numerous on-ramps and off-ramps that connect him to his hometown of Angelito in the center of centerless Los Angeles. But when death and love, perhaps, arrive unexpectedly, Adam must learn that trouble sometimes has to rumble through a tidy world to make room for the kind of magical connections that make life worth living."
