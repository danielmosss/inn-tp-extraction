    "text": " The novel tells of several generations of the fictional Gursky family, who are connected to several disparate events in the history of Canada, including the Franklin Expedition and rum-running. Some fans and critics have cited this as Mordecai Richler's best book, and in terms of scope and style it is unmatched by his other works. The parallels between the Gursky family and the Bronfmans are such that the novel \"may be seen as a thinly disguised account of the [Bronfman] family\". While Richler himself denied any similarities, \"one longtime Bronfman associate put it, 'I don't know why Mordecai bothered to change the names.'\""
