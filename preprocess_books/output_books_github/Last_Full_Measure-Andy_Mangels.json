    "text": " An alien weapon attacks Earth, unleashing energies that kills millions across two continents. A second such rumoured weapon could destroy the planet. The 'Enterprise' accepts a contingent of 'MACOS', Military Assault Command Operations personnel, and track down the source of the alien attack. The military men and the Starfleet officers come into conflict over the ways to perform the mission but both sides realize they must work together or perish."
