    "text": " Cordelia suggests beginning a Web site for their detective agency, but Angel is hesitantâ€”as Doyle points out, \"people in trouble want to interface with a face.\" Meanwhile the police discover a trail of corpses across the city. The only connection between these victims (apart from the cause of death) is their hobby of online chatting. It seems a techno-savvy demon must be on the prowl, hoping to complete a ritual going even beyond a World Wide Web."
