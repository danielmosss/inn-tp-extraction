    "text": " Sam Oliver McQueen is an eleven-year-old child, terminally ill with leukaemia, who, during one of his special education sessions decides to write a book about his life. In the book he talks about his life while being ill, the things he'll remember when he dies and, in a section called \"Things I want to do\", Sam makes numerous lists of questions. With the help of his teacher and friend Felix Stranger (who is also ill with cancer), they conduct various experiments, Sam and Felix break world records (including the world's smallest night club). However things take a turn for the worse and Felix becomes ill, this surprises Sam as Felix was known as a 'fighter'. But in this scenario the opposite happens and Felix dies in hospital. This leaves Sam devastated. Sam and his family go to Felix's funeral. Sam is puzzled by the sadness and writes in his book that everyone should have been happy and making jokes and Felix should have worn his favourite top. Having said, that he told in his book he wanted to make sure no one would do that at his funeral. A couple of weeks later, the doctors realize the medication isn't working as well and Sam makes the decision to stop all medication. Sam finishes his list of \"Things to do\" and about a month later he has a dream: all his family (his dad, his mum and his sister Ella) are all sleeping togetherâ€¦ then he wakes up and sees his dads face. His dad says \"I love you\", but Sam drifts back asleep. Sam dies in his sleep; but he has given his parents a form to fill in about his death so he could finish his book. The last comment is made by his mother, who says, \"Sam died quietly in his sleep. He was in no pain.\" The book was made into a film during 2010."
