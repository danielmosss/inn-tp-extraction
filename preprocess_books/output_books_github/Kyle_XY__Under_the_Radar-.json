    "text": " The story once again begins with the rather strange life of Kyle Trager. A few days after the bonfire and the release of the infamous \"list,\" Kyle is trying reconnect with Amanda Bloom, while Lori struggles with her own relationship to Declan, who has become distant unexpectedly. After a freshman student cuts through a park near the school, he finds himself being chased by a football jock, who catches up with him on school grounds and brutally attacks him. When Kyle sees the student in trouble, he immediately steps in and delays the larger and more muscular jock with ease. Immediately Kyle's popularity rises, which quickly has an unintentional effect on Josh, who has grown jealous of Kyle's new status. Kyle's popularity jumps once more when he is nominated for school student government president. Once learning of the job and responsibility required, he believes he can live in Baylin's words and make a difference, while also winning back Amanda. Josh grows even more jealous of Kyle and wants to find a way to get himself noticed, against Andy's best advice. While Kyle is excited at the thought of becoming school president, his trainer, Tom Foss, disagrees. Foss believes that the election could be a trap meant to lure Kyle out into the open. Foss attempts to teach Kyle to see through an object, a talent Baylin used only once and discovered shortly before his death. Upon the end of the training session, Foss presents Kyle with Baylin's journal hoping it will bring Kyle to his senses, but the early entries only exaggerated Kyle's quest to make a difference. As Kyle prepared to run for the election, Lori used her newly self-appointed position as campaign manager to avoid thinking about her failing relationship with Declan, and avoid the fact that she really isn't over Declan. Josh attempts to hatch a scheme to bring himself into the center of attention, as everyone goading over how awesome Kyle was had begun to prey on his mind. Against Andy's judgment, Josh sneaks into the school at night and steals the donkey and elephant stuffed animals put out every year during the election, previously thought to be impossible. On the day of the election, every student was impressed with the prank Josh performed, only another student tried to take responsibility; Josh foolishly told the students the prank was his own idea. As Kyle began his speech, the assembly chanted for a Trager, but Josh, not Kyle, and Josh was escorted from the assembly and disciplined. Kyle's speech went over extremely well, and it seemed Kyle was a shoo-in for victory, but when Kyle discovered a strange metallic device in his backpack, and read more of Baylin's journal, he realized how dangerous being in the spotlight had become. After flushing the device down the toilet, Kyle made his way to the votes room, attempting to prevent himself from winning, but a locked door stood in his way. Finally realizing what all his training had been for, Kyle used telekinesis to toss out some of his votes. When being brought on stage to announce the winner, Kyle feels incredibly sick, collapses and goes into seizures. When the ambulance arrives, Foss sneaks aboard and changes Kyle's test and symptoms to dissuade any questions. Kyle realizes that he must stay under the radar to avoid bringing any danger to himself or the Tragers. Josh's parents reconcile with him, realizing that they all had got swept up by Kyle's success. Kyle was now prepared to focus on his training, finally committed, and keeping his secrets at all costs."
