    "text": " Many have likened Join My Cult!s non-linear or cut-up style to Thomas Pynchon, William Burroughs, and Robert Anton Wilson. Also like the works of these authors, there have been heated debates about its cultural value or lack thereof. Various plot elements focus on groups of suburban kids experimenting with shamanism and hallucinogens, who quickly discover themselves unhinged from the culture around them. It details events surrounding their harrowing plunge into this abyss, regularly shifting narrator and frame of reference from one member of the group to the other. Curcio utilizes atypical narrative and grammatical structures in the form of neurolinguistic and hypnotic confusion techniques within the text in an effort to stimulate a similar experience over the course of reading. That Curcio was intentionally utilizing these techniques is shown in various interviews such as a Gpod radio interview found on his website."
