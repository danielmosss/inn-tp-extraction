    "text": " The story is set in Australia, and involves an orphaned city boy named Simon Brent who comes to live on a 5000 acre sheep station called Wongadilla, in the Hunter Valley, with his mother's second cousins, Edie and Charlie. In a remote valley on the property he discovers a variety of ancient Australian Dreamtime creatures. The arrival of heavy machinery intent on clearing the land brings to life the ominous stone Nargun. The Nargun is a creature drawn from tribal legends of the Gunai or Kurnai people of the area now known as the Mitchell River National Park in Victoria. Other creatures featured in the story include the mischievous green-scaled water-spiritâ€”Potkoorok, the Turongs (tree people) and the Nyols (cave people)."
