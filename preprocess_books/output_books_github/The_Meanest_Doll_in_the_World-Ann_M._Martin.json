    "text": " The novel revolves around the troubles that Annabelle Doll and Tiffany Funcraft get into when trying to hide from their owner, Kate Palmer. They hide in her backpack and get taken to school. There, they explore and eventually get into a backpack they think is Kate's but it is really the backpack of a different child, named BJ. The dolls are taken to BJ's house where they meet Waterfall, Melody, Yvonne, Penny, and Beth, the toys of BJ's sister, Callie. Annabelle and Tiffany are introduced to the meanest doll in the world, Princess Mimi (called by the toys Mean Mimi). Mean Mimi tries to boss them around too, but Annabelle and Tiffany escape back into BJ's backpack where, at school, they can get back into Kate's backpack and then home to their worried families. Little do they know that Mean Mimi has followed them. At the Palmers' house, Mimi mimics crying and tricks the Dolls and the Funcrafts into letting her stay with them. What they do not know is that Mimi is trying to torture them, too. She tries to wake up Kate so she will know about the mess she made, and think the dolls did it. Nora, Kate's little sister, sees Mean Mimi jump off Kate's bookshelf in a stunt to expose the life of dolls, and Mimi goes into Permanent Doll State. In which dolls cannot come to life ever again because they put the secret life of dolls at risk of being exposed. So at the end of the story, Mean Mimi, still in Permanent Doll State, is taken to Kate's school where she ends up in the lost and found. Mean Mimi remained forever unfound at the school."
