    "text": " Young Boba Fett continues to grow as a bounty hunter in service of Jabba the Hutt. As he returns with his latest kill, he is immediately sent out again on his most dangerous mission ever. The Republic has secretly hired Jabba's bounty hunters to capture or assassinate key members of the Separatist's leadership. At their request, Jabba sends Boba Fett after Wat Tambor. The Techno Union representative is holed up in a fortress on the planet of Xagobah. His fortress also happens to be under siege by the Jedi and the Clone Trooper army. Despite this, Jabba still wants to collect the bounty for himself. Boba must face many dangers to capture Wat Tambor, but little does he know that an unknown new threat guards the Separatist â€“ General Grievous!"
