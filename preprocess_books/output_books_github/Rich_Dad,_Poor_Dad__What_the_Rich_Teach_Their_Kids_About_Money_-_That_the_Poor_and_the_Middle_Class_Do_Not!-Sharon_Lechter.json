    "text": " The book is largely based on Kiyosaki's upbringing and education in Hawaii. The book highlights the different attitudes to money work and life of two men (His rich dad and his poor dad), and how they in turn influenced key decisions in Kiyosaki's life. Among some of the book's topics are: * Robert Kyosaki's personal story * The difference between assets and liabilities * What the rich teach their kids about money that the poor and middle class do not * Your house is not an asset, unless you use it to produce revenue * The value of financial intelligence and financial literacy * That corporations spend first, then pay taxes, while individuals must pay taxes first * That corporations are artificial entities that anyone can use, but the poor usually do not know how * The importance of investing and entrepreneurship Kiyosaki advocated Dr. Buckminster Fuller's views on wealth, that wealth is measured by the number of days the income from your assets can sustain you, and financial independence is achieved when your monthly income from assets exceeds your monthly expenses."
