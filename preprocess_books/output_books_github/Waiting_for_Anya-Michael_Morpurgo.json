After an incident with a bear, Jo meets a mysterious man in the forest. He follows the man to his home and learns his secret - he is a Jew named Benjamin that is responsible for smuggling Jewish children across the border into Spain, and safety, with the help of his mother-in-law (Widow Horcada). Jo starts helping them, and proving that he is one person who can be trusted. When German soldiers move into town, things becomes much more difficult.

The plan requires the whole town help the children escape, and relies on the German soldiers not noticing what is happening. But if they are caught, their lives will not be worth living...
