    "text": " After Admiral Hardcastle warns the world about America's lack of guards against terrorism, the horrors begin. Henri Cazaux, a psychopathic terrorist, attacks the heartland and then the San Francisco airport with explosives. The country is terrorized. The US authorities are overwhelmed. A single-engine Cessna, loaded with explosives, attacks the White House. Soon after publication, when Frank Eugene Corder flew in a Cessna at low altitude to the White House and crashed on the grounds, newspapers noted similarities. No explosives were found in the wreckage of the plane Corder flew."
