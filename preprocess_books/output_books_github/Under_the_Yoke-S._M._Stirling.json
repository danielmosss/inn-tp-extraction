    "text": " Tanya von Shrakenberg established a plantation in formerly-French Touraine Province. Her slaves include Marya Sokolowska and Chantal Lefarge, formerly a Polish nun and a French Communist respectively. Fred Kustaa, agent for the Alliance secret service (the OSS), attempts to keep a resistance movement alive in Europe. He smuggles weapons to guerillas in Finland, and later attempts to smuggle the German professor Ernst Oerbach, who has vital knowledge on nuclear fusion. Marya Sokolowska is Fred's contact in this second mission. Chantal Lefarge meanwhile is raped by Tanya's husband, and impregnated with twins. Fred attempts to flee but things go wrong leading to the deaths of Fred, Marya, and Ernst. Chantal manages to escape to the USA on a submarine. In New York City, she gives birth to Fred and Marya Lefarge (named after her rescuers)."
