    "text": " Hot rod TV show producer Grant Tucker has hired the Hardy boys following several mysterious accidents; an unknown extortionist has been demanding a quarter of a million bucks in cash. Several dangerous accidents happen, with monster trucks without drivers going on rampage, tires coming off, and hot rods going up in flames. In the end, Joe and star rider Jessica Derey have a hair's breadth escape, narrowly escaping being crushed by a monster pickup on a live TV show. They also catch the extortionist, a former star who was involved in a major accident, got scared of driving, and managed to work up a lot of resentment, which was why he decided to damage the show by crippling it financially."
