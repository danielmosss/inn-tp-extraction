    "text": " The plot focuses on three key events that happen mostly simultaneously. The first is the occupation of Coruscant and the trouble the Empire left behind with its crippling bio-attack on the planet. The virus used in the attack is the Krytos virus, a biological weapon developed by General Evir Derricote and released under the orders of Imperial leader Ysanne Isard. Humans are apparently immune, while all other species are vulnerable. This, combined with Imperial Intelligence officer Kirtan Loor's terrorist activities while taking orders from the Palpatine Counterinsurgency Front, leaves Coruscant and the New Republic in a state of emergency. The second event is the treason trial of Rogue Squadron executive officer Tycho Celchu, who is suspected of murdering Rogue Squadron pilot Corran Horn, who was captured during the invasion. Finally, Corran Horn is being held prisoner in her Lusankya prison facility. His attempts to escape lead him to uncover the secret of Rogue Squadron's mole, and it becomes a race against time to save the innocent and reveal the true traitor."
