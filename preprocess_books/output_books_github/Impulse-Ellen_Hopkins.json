He and his sister are supposed to be perfect. His sister has achieved that status in the eyes of Connor's parents. However, when his parents' try to force him to live up to their impossible standards, Connor's only choice is to pull the trigger. Vanessa grew up in a broken family. Her father is overseas, her mother does anything to stop the hurt, and on top of it all Vanessa has to worry about watching after her little brother. When her Mother starts going crazy and talking to her \"angel\", Vanessa's only comfort is to put the blade to her wrist. Tony grew up in the streets mainly. His father abandoned him, while his mother hooks up with anybody. They leave their son all alone to deal with the hardships of life. Tony was sexually abused by one of his mother's boyfriends. Tony ended up killing the boyfriend. The only person that Tony could trust was his friend, Phillip, but when Phillip died, Tony's only decision was to swallow the pills. Three teens, three different stories, one death wish. Their lives will intersect at a psych hospital. Can they help each other deal with the pain of their previous lives? Most importantly, can they help themselves move beyond their personal demons? Or will the IMPULSE take control?"
