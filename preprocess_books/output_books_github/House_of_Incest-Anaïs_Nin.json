    "text": " Nin's usage of the word incest in this case is metaphorical, not literal. In other words, in this book the word \"incest\" describes a selfish love where one can appreciate in another only that which is similar to oneself. One is then only loving oneself, shunning all differences. At first, such a self-love can seem ideal because it is without fear and without risk. But eventually it becomes a sterile nightmare. Toward the end of the book, the character called \"the modern Christ\" puts Nin’s use of the word into context: “If only we could all escape from this house of incest, where we only love ourselves in the other.\" Nin was under the analysis of Otto Rank during the period of writing House of Incest. Rank was an early disciple of Freud, serving as the secretary and youngest member of his Vienna group, but had long since dissented from Freudian orthodoxy and developed his own theoretical school. Incest: From a Journal of Love\"—The Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin (1932–1934) reveals that the two were also having an affair. Rank helped Anaïs edit House of Incest. He had experience with this topic, as Otto Rank's most famous book is The Trauma of Birth. House of Incest is largely an attempt by the narrator to cope with the shock of the trauma of birth. Anaïs Nin describes the process as akin to being \"[e]jected from a paradise of soundlessness.... thrown up on a rock, the skeleton of a ship choked in its own sails.\""
