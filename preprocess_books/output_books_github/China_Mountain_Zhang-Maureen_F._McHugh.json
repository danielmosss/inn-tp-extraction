    "text": " The main story involves a man's maturation in a future dominated by China, where the United States has undergone a Communist revolution (the \"Cleansing Winds Campaign\") after a period of economic crisis. His personal evolution is paralleled by four side stories in his narrative, following characters progressing from arrogant outsiders to finding a place in society. These stories never fully interconnect in the normal manner of a novel."
