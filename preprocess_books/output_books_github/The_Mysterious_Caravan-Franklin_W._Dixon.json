They meet William along the way, a kind African who is willing to help them uncover secrets of the mask, which they find out is Jamaican property. William scares off the enemies of the Hardy Boys in Swahili, telling them he is an even more powerful Juju man then theirs and eventually Mr. Hardy comes after Frank and Joe thought they were dead. Back at the Celliers', they celebrate and Christine, the gorgeous, black-haired teen lets the Hardys call home to their worrying mother and Aunt Gertrude. William even receives a wild dog as a present for saving the Hardys from the predicament."
