    "text": " Room One is a story about sixth grader Ted Hammond. He is an avid mystery fan and detective. But on one of his normal newspaper routes, he looks into the Andersons' house. He sees a mysterious face through the attic window. He passes by but soon remembers that the Andersons moved out years ago. That's when Ted became determined to find out whose, or what's, face that is. It turns out to be April (who he thought was Alexa), a girl with a deep past regarding her family and their problems."
