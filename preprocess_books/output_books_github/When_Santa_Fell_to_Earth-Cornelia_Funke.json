    "text": " Gerold Geronimus Goblynch leads the Great Christmas Council and outlaws all of the old magical ways. Snowmobiles are to replace reindeer, elves and angels are banned, and Santas who go against these policies are turned into chocolate. Niklas Goodfellow, a spirited, humorous young Santa, emerges as the last, and thus real Santa. He and two angels named Matilda and Emmanuel, an invisible reindeer, and a bunch of elves go into hiding from the Council. Two children named Ben and Charlotte and Charlotte's dog, Mutt, join forces to save Niklas from being turned into chocolate."
