Leia sends a message to Corellia about the attack and that they would like some help to find out who is behind the attacks. When they do not reply, Leia and Han Solo, along with their children and Chewbacca, head to Corellia. They are ambushed by Corellian Rebels and learn that the Corellian system has turned away from the Republic, building a new Corellian Republic. Han, Leia, and Chewbacca must escape Corellia and return safely home to Coruscant."
