    "text": " Greg Kenton is a 6th-grader with considerable talent, but whose greatest talent is as an entrepreneur. His newest business, Chunky Comics, is successful, until long-time rival and business competitor, Maura Shaw, distributes mini books of her own. Eventually, the two come together to form a partnership, and also friendship. The principal, Mrs. Davenport, has some doubts about granting them permission to sell their comics, but eventually consents. Chunky Comics becomes a huge domestic hit, and is eventually distributed nationally on eBay."
