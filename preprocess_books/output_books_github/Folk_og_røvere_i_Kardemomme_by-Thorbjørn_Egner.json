    "text": " The book is about the peaceful town of Kardemomme and the people there, as well as the only characters which stir up serious trouble. They are the three robbers, Casper, Jasper and Jonathan who live outside the town and regularly enter to steal the things they need. In the end the robbers are arrested, but good treatment in the jail by the kindly constable Bastian reforms them, and in the final chapter they become the heroes of the day when they extinguish a fire in the tower of the town. At the end Casper becomes the town's fireman, Jasper becomes the town's circus manager and Jonathan becomes the town's baker."
