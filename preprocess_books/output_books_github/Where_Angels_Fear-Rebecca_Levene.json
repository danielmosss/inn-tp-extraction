    "text": " Bernice's home planet of Dellah, once a place of learning, is being overrun by a new religious movement. Closer investigation reveals the major powers of the universe are literally running in fear from said movement. Levene had been editor of the New Adventures for some years, with Winstone latterly her deputy and then her successor. Where Angels Fear was commissioned as Levene handed over to Winstone and it sets up a story arc that ran through to the final New Adventure, Twilight of the Gods."
