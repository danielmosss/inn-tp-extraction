    "text": " Conan finds himself in the kingdom of Zamora, a fugitive under suspicion of kidnapping Jamilah, the wife of the king of Turan. Discovering she has actually been taken by devotees of the Zamoran spider god Zath, he sets out for the city of Yezud to rescue the captive, and incidentally steal the opals set as eyes in the god's temple image. Characteristically, de Camp's Conan is a more credible if less elemental figure than Howard's, carefully assessing the situation in Yezud and taking the time and effort to lay the groundwork for his foray rather than just barreling in swinging his sword. Chronologically, Conan and the Spider God comes between the short stories \"The Curse of the Monolith\" and \"The Blood-Stained God\"."
