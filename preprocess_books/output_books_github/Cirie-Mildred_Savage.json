    "text": " In this sweeping historical novel of the Russian Revolution, Cirie, clever and beautiful, uses her cool wits and sensuous charm first to make her way among the high nobility of the Romanov world, and then to survive and escape the Revolution that utterly destroys her world. Later in New York during the Great Depression, she is sustained by the survival skills she forged as imperial Russia fell apart. A huge novel of love and deception, chaos and perseverance, in the most shattering upheaval the world has ever known, Cirie is the story of a true 20th century heroine and the times that produced her."
