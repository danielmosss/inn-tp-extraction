    "text": " Eisengrim (also known by at least four other names throughout the trilogy) tells the story of his life to a group of filmmakers who are producing a biographical film about the great magician Jean Eug√®ne Robert-Houdin for the BBC. They are headed by the world famous Swedish director Jurgen Lind, evidently modeled on Ingmar Bergman. Also present during the story are Eisengrim's friends Dunstan Ramsay and Liesl, who both appear in the earlier instalments of the Deptford Trilogy. Ramsay reprises the role of narrator that he played in the first novel, Fifth Business, but in this case it is only to add context and continuity to the internal narration of Eisengrim. The life story of Eisengrim pulls together many events found throughout the previous two novels, showing them from an entirely different perspective."
