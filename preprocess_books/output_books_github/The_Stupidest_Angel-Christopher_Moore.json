    "text": " An angel named Raziel (previously in Moore's novel Lamb) is sent to Earth to grant the wish of a child; he decides to help a boy who has witnessed the death of a man dressed as Santa Claus. Meanwhile, the town is preparing to have a community dinner-gathering at the local church, where the cemetery is located. In his inept attempt to bring the \"Santa\" back to life, the angel causes the townspeople to be put under siege by brain-hungry zombies who arise from their burial spots."
