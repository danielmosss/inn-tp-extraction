    "text": " Michael McGill, a burned-out private eye is hired by a corrupt White House Chief of Staff to find a second \"secret\" United States Constitution, which had been lost in a whorehouse by Richard Nixon. What follows is a scavenger hunt across America, exposing its seedier side along the way. McGill is joined by surreal college student side-kick, Trix, who is writing a thesis on sexual fetishes. McGill has to deal with strange events sometimes unrelated to his adventures â€“ he describes himself as a 'shit-magnet', with weird phenomena following him wherever he goes."
