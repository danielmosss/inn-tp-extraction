    "text": " \"The Owl and the Pussycat\" features four anthropomorphic animals &ndash; an owl, a cat, a pig, and a turkey &ndash; and tells the story of the love between the title characters who marry in the land \"where the Bong-tree grows\". The Owl and the Pussycat set out to sea in a pea green boat with honey and \"plenty of money\" wrapped in a five pound note. The Owl serenades the Pussycat while gazing at the stars and strumming on a small guitar. He describes her as beautiful. The Pussycat responds by describing the Owl as an \"elegant fowl\" and compliments him on his singing. She urges they marry but they don't have a ring. They sail away for a year and a day to a land where Bong-trees grow and discover a pig with a ring in his nose in a wood. They buy the ring for a shilling and are married the next day by a turkey. They dine on mince and quince using a runcible spoon, then dance hand-in-hand on the sand in the moonlight. Portions of an unfinished sequel, \"The Children of the Owl and the Pussycat\", were first published posthumously in 1938."
