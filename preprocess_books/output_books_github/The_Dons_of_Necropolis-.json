    "text": " Ricky Bianca needs to know why his father committed suicide when he was a child on Christmas Eve. Unfortunately, his father at the time was fighting the Mafia from controlling the funeral industry. The Mafia sent a friend to deliver a letter on that holy night and after reading the letter, he blew his brains out. The letter was never found and no one but the head Don, Salvatore Biganti, knows what it contained. When Ricky heard the blast, he ran to his father's aid only to see him on the floor bleeding profusely from his temple. He knelt in a pool of blood and held his father's head, unsuccessfully trying to stop the bleeding. Subsequently, Ricky has no recollection of the event but suffers from wild nightmarish hallucinations. His mother soon thereafter died in an upstate sanitarium of severe depressive catatonia. His aunt in Connecticut raises him and after twenty years he decides to return to New York as a Funeral Director, back to the industry that holds the secret. His Psychology Professor friend at college advised him to get the answers his mind so desperately needs, before his hallucinogenic demons devour him. His innocence is lost as this cryptic industry leads him through a maze of deceit, greed and evil. Subsequently, he gets caught in an intricate spiderâ€™s web of organized crime, secret cults and unspeakable atrocities. The truth is, the known is worse than the unknown and it sends him spiraling down into a hell of fiendish demons and worse nightmares."
