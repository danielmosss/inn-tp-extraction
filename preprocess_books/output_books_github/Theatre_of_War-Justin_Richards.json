    "text": " An archeological expedition to the planet Mexaus ends in tragedy; all but one of the visitors die and lethal radiation contaminates the surface. Now the survivor is leading a new trip, with Professor Bernice Summerfield. Murders start again. Bernice summons her friends, the Doctor and Ace. They are sucked into a dangerously real re-creation of Shakespeare's greatest tragic play, Hamlet, which is paralleled by \"The Good Soldiers,\" the (fictitious) purportedly lost play of the future playwright Stanoff Osterling."
