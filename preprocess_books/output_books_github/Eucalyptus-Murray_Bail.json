    "text": " Eucalyptus tells the story of Ellen Holland, a young woman whose \"speckled beauty\" and unattainability become legend far beyond the rural western New South Wales town near the property where she grows up. Her protective father's obsession with collecting rare species of Eucalyptus trees leads him to propose a contest - the man who can correctly name all the species on his property shall win her hand in marriage."
