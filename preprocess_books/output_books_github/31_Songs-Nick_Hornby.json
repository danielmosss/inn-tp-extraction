    "text": " The music varies from established classics like Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan to independents like Ani DiFranco, Top 40 pop like Nelly Furtado, and a few songs with special meaning only to Hornby. Song by song, Hornby delves into what makes music catchy or classic, and how it can come to play an integral role in a person's emotional life. Proceeds from the book go to the TreeHouse Trust, a UK charity operating a school for children with autism and communications disorders, which Hornby's son attends, and to 826 Valencia, a U.S.-based learning center, founded by McSweeney's publisher Dave Eggers, that offers writing workshops and tutoring. The paperback edition of Songbook adds a few music-related essays by Hornby from other sources. After the release of \"Songbook,\" McSweeney accepted online submissions from authors writing about their favorite songs in the same manner as Hornby. These submissions were posted to the McSweeney website. Additionally, TheBlueScarf is a blog adaptation of Hornby's collection. After Hornby mentioned he was a fan in Songbook, Ben Folds contacted him and Hornby wrote the song \"That's Me Trying\" for William Shatner's album Has Been."
