    "text": " In the 1950s, a man finds himself in the middle of the streets of Porto Alegre with a wallet full of money... and no memory of any past events. He finds two \"vultures of the night\", enigmatic noctivague figures with a high penchant for bohemian lifestyles. The \"vultures\" (called The Master and The Hunchback) take the man on a surrealistic journey through the darkest places of the city, to \"enjoy the night\": a funeral parlor, the emergency service of a hospital, a deluxe whorehouse and a low-level working class cabaret. At the same time, the two enigmatic figures surreptitiously try to make the man-with-no-memory assume that he committed a horrendous crime early that night, in which a woman was the subject of a brutal passion-related crime and no perpetrator was yet arrested by the police. The book has a unique atmosphere in depicting the low-level bohemy that crowded some places in the Brazilian urban legends. In the 1980s, Brazilian film director Jos√© Louzeiro conducted a movie loosely based on the book."
