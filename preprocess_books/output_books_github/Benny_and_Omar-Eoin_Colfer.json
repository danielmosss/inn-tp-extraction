    "text": " An Irish boy, named Benny, who is in an all-Ireland hurling team, journeys to Tunisia because of his father's new oversea job. He is determined to hate and find fault with the country and annoys everyone. Then he meets another boy called Omar. They develop a friendship, through Omar's \"telly-speak\" English. Benny's father bans Benny from seeing Omar because he thinks that Omar is a bad influence, and because Benny went off with Omar when he was supposed to look after his brother. Benny endures punishment for being with Omar but that doesn't stop him from running away with him the second his parents trust him again to rescue Omar's drugged and hospitalized sister Kaheena. Benny is exposed to real life in Tunisia, actual pain and suffering bigger than losing a sports match, and realizes just how lucky he is after Omar drowns in a flood (although, this is, in fact, arguable, as the bracelet Benny gave to Omar was recovered, but Omar had \"vanished\")."
