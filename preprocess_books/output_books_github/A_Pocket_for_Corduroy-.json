    "text": " A young girl, Lisa, accidentally leaves her stuffed bear, Corduroy, in a laundromat. After a series of adventures, while Corduroy searches for material to make a pocket, he becomes trapped in a laundry basket until he is found the next morning by the laundromat's owner. Corduroy is reunited with Lisa, who promptly takes him home to sew a pocket onto his overalls, so that Corduroy can carry a name card with him."
