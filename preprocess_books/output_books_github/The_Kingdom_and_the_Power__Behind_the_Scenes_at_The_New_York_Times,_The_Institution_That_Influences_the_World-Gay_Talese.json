    "text": " While Talese's book outlined the history of the paper back to Adolph Ochs's 1896 takeover of the then-failing paper, the focus was on The Times between 1945 and the 1960s. The Washington bureau of The Times sometimes was seen as the center of the paper's power, but after the death of publisher Orvil Dryfoos in 1963, Talese saw this center as shifting to New York City under Arthur Ochs \"Punch\" Sulzberger beginning in 1963. The title of the book indicated the thrust of Talese's thesis. The Kingdom was The New York Times newsroom, and the Power was the influence the paper wielded, particularly in its interpretation of the paper's famous motto \"All the News That's Fit to Print\". Talese looked at the personalities driving Times news coverage such as managing editor Clifton Daniel, executive editor James Reston, rising star A. M. Rosenthal and Punch Sulzberger. Time found Talese's portrayal of the highly-respected Reston as particularly critical. Talese described Reston as a \"Times-man in the old sense, a man emotionally committed to the institution as a way of life, a religion, a cult.\""
