    "text": " It is the story of a 17th century Italian nobleman, Roberto della Griva, who is the only survivor of a shipwreck during a fierce storm. He finds himself washed up on an abandoned ship in a harbour through which, he convinces himself, runs the International Date Line. Although he can see land, his inability to swim leaves him marooned and he begins to reminisce about his life and his love. He becomes obsessed about his allegedly evil twin brother, who is split from his own persona through a process reminiscent of the doppelganger effect, and thus accusing him of all the bad things that happened in his life. The brother takes blame mainly for his bad choices and is present to sweeten the disappointments of life. Through this reminiscence he becomes convinced that all his troubles will end, if only he can reach the land. The story is told from the point of view of a modern editor who has sorted through the man's papers. Exactly how the papers were preserved and eventually handed down to the editor remains a point of conjecture. bg:Островът от предишния ден cs:Ostrov včerejšího dne de:Die Insel des vorigen Tages es:La isla del día de antes fr:L'Île du jour d'avant it:L'isola del giorno prima he:האי של יום האתמול hu:A tegnap szigete nl:Het eiland van de vorige dag pl:Wyspa dnia poprzedniego pt:L'isola del giorno prima ro:Insula din ziua de ieri ru:Остров накануне sk:Ostrov včerajšieho dňa fi:Edellisen päivän saari tr:Önceki Günün Adası uk:Острів попереднього дня"
