    "text": " When a rabbit being tested on to find a cure against a deadly virus, a more dangerous form of Ebola, is stolen from a lab in Scotland. Toni Gallo, head of security, knows that she has failed. But soon things turn out to be a lot worse when the virus itself is also stolen, with inside assistance, to be used in a terrorist attack. Through a Christmas Eve blizzard, and without much help from the local police, Toni has to chase the thieves to recover the virus and save the future of the lab as well as prevent a dangerous outbreak. Meanwhile, she's falling in love with her boss, who is having the family over for Christmas at his nearby mansion."
