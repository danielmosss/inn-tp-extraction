    "text": " It started out as an innocent road trip to Carlsbad Caverns to unwind, but now Max, Isabel, Michael, Liz, and Maria are totally regretting their plan. Hundreds of feet underground, in the cavern gift shop, Liz turns and is stunned to see someone she thought she'd never meet againâ€”the man who shot her long ago in the diner. Their eyes meet and Liz bolts. But running won't solve the group's new \"problem.\" Because the shooter has recognized Liz. Now he wants her dead. And nobody knows why."
