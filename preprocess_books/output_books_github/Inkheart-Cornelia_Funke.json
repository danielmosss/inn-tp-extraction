    "text": " Inkheart follows the adventures of a 12-year-old girl named Meggie Folchart. Her life changes dramatically when she discovers that her father, a bookbinder named Mortimer, or Mo as Meggie always calls him, has an unusual ability which is that when he reads aloud, he can bring characters and items from books into the real world. When Meggie was three years old, Mo read a book called Inkheart aloud to her mother. In an instant, Meggie's mother, Resa, and the family's two pet cats vanished into the Inkworld and three men from the novel (two of whom are murderous villains) entered into the real world. Nine years later, these men have come back into their lives and Mo, Meggie, and Resa's aunt Elinor need to return the villains back to the book's pages."
