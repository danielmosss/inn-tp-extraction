    "text": " The Russian author Kartsev, living in Munich in 1982 (just like Voinovich himself), time travels to the Moscow of 2042. After the \"Great August Revolution\", the new leader referred to as \"Genialissimus\" has changed the Soviet Union... up to a certain point. After Vladimir Lenin's dream of the world revolution narrowed down to Joseph Stalin's theory of \"Socialism in one country\", Genialissimus has decided to start from building \"Communism in one city\", namely in Moscow. The ideology has changed somewhat, into a hodgepodge of Marxism-Leninism and Russian Orthodoxy (Genialissimo himself is also Patriarch). The decay from which the Soviet Union suffered has worsened. The rest of the Soviet Union, where people barely survive, has been separated by a Berlin type of wall from the \"paradise\" of Moscow, where communism has been realised. Within the wall everyone gets everything \"according to his needs\". Only their needs are not decided by themselves, but by the wise Genialissimus. Most people have \"ordinary needs\", but a chosen few have \"extraordinary needs\". For the first-mentioned group, life is dismal even within the privileged \"Moscow Republic\". The situation finally gets so desperate that people throw themselves in the arms of the \"liberator\", a fellow dissident writer and (kind of) friend of Kartsev, the Slavophile Sim Karnavalov (apparently inspired by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn), who enters Moscow on a white horse and proclaims himself Tsar Serafim the First. Thus, communism is abandoned and society progressed back into feudal autocracy. This novel is considered to be a masterpiece of dystopian satire."
