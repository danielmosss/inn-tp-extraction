    "text": " Wedge Antilles, fresh back from the Bacta War on Thyferra, decides to make a new fighter squadron/commando team. While pitching the idea to Admiral Ackbar, he proposes a way to build the squadron without any cost to the New Republic: he'll use screw-ups, wash-outs, and pilots who are a hair's breadth of being kicked out of Fighter Command&mdash;the pilots that no one else will take. Whilst Rogue Squadron was compiled from elite pilots with ground fighting expertise as a secondary, this new squadron was to be consisted of expert ground combatants with piloting skills as a secondary. Antilles, with help from Wes Janson, scrounges up a team that comes to be known as Wraith Squadron: *Jesmin Ackbar, communications expert and the niece of Admiral Ackbar *Hohass \"Runt\" Ekwesh, a Thakwaash with multiple personalities *Garik \"Face\" Loran, a former Imperial child-recruitment actor *Voort \"Piggy\" SaBinring, a Gamorrean pilot *Kell Tainer, the son of a Rebel pilot that Janson was forced to kill and a demolitions expert *Myn Donos, the sole surviving pilot of an Imperial ambush to his Talon squadron *Ton Phanan, former doctor and part mechanical *Falynn Sandskimmer, vehicle specialist from Tatooine with chronic insolence *Tyria Sarkin, former Antari Ranger with minor Force abilities *Eurrsk \"Grinder\" Thri'ag, an expert code slicer and prankster The novel focuses on Wraith Squadron's antics as it goes undercover as the crew of Night Caller, an Imperial blockade runner under the employ of Warlord Zsinj."
