    "text": " Mayor Richard Wilkins III invites a woman named Belakane to speak at the local Sunnydale High School. She has a program, \"Be the Ultimate You!\". It aims to build self-esteem in teenagers. However she is a demon ant-like queen and her so-called self-esteem program is actually a test to find workers to build her colony, and to find mates to expand her populace. She soon reduces students to single trait beings, for example Buffy is reduced to 'aggressive slayer'."
