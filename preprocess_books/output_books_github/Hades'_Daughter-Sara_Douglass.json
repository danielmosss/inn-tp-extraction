It is set in the Late Bronze Age (approx. 1000-1200 BC) during the time of the great Aegean Catastrophe and some years after the fall of Troy. The action ranges between Naxos, western Greece and the mysterious land of Llangarlia in the Isle of Albion (Britain). The main characters are: * Genvissa, sixth daughter-heir of Ariadne (lover of Theseus), and the MagaLlan of Llangarlia. * Brutus, leader of the Trojans. * Membricus, Brutus' former lover and now his adviser. * Asterion, the murdered Minotaur, half-brother to Ariadne. * Cornelia, Brutus' wife, and the central character of the first three books of the series. * Corineus, Brutus' captain. * Coel, a Llangarlian mystic and warrior; also temporary lover of Cornelia. * Loth, a strange, enigmatic Llangarlian man with a distorted antler-shaped head. * Aerne, Gormagog of Llangarlia. * Mag, Mother Goddess of the Waters of Llangarlia. * And a host of various supporting characters."
