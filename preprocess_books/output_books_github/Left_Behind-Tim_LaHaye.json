    "text": " The story takes place during the Rapture. Millions of people suddenly vanish and frantic \"survivors\" of the disappearances begin their search for their friends and families, as well as answers to what has happened. Among them are pilot Rayford Steele, his daughter Chloe Steele, and pastor Bruce Barnes, who begin to discover that the Rapture has taken place. Meanwhile, a young journalist, Cameron \"Buck\" Williams, follows an unknown, but charming, Romanian politician named Nicolae Carpathia, who quickly attracts millions of followers - seemingly overnight."
