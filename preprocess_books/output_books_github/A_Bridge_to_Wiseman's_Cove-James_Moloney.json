During his stay at Wattle Beach, Carl works in a barge, an old colleague of Carl's grandfather. Carl does not know that his grandfather was involved in an accident that killed Skips 8-year-old son, Graham. Carl is initially withdrawn; he does not convey his worries about his missing mother, nor the anxiety that he feels over his rebellious younger brother, who is constantly in centrelink. However, during the course of the novel he learns to \"open up\" and share his feelings with those who care about him. In the end, it is discovered that Kerry Matt died in a bus accident when she was trying to get home to her children, Sarah, Harley and Carl. Once this is unearthed,Carl returns home to find that Aunt Beryl has run off in true Matt spirit to join her boyfriend, Bruce. Because Carl has nowhere else to stay, Joy Duncan invites him to come and live with them at Wiseman's Cove with his brother, Harley, who has already claimed the Duncans as his surrogate family. Their sister Sarah left them and flew to another country to get a chance at her own life."
