    "text": " Simulacron 3 is the story of a virtual city (total environment simulator) for marketing research, developed by a scientist to reduce the need for opinion polls. The computer-generated city simulation is so well-programmed, that, although the inhabitants have their own consciousness, they are unaware, except for one, that they are only electronic impulses in a computer. The simulator’s lead scientist, Hannon Fuller, dies mysteriously, and a co-worker, Morton Lynch, vanishes. The protagonist, Douglas Hall, is with Lynch when he vanishes, and Hall subsequently struggles to suppress his inchoate madness. As time and events unwind, he progressively grasps that his own world is probably not “real” and might be only a computer-generated simulation. Symbolically, the title term \"Simulacron-3\" refers to the just-built virtual reality simulator and ostensibly references a third attempt at \"simulectronics\" (the reality-simulating technology), however, the \"3\" also refers to the novel’s three levels of \"reality,\" or three levels of computer simulation — if the final, \"real\" world is simulated. Moreover, \"simulacron\" is closely derivative of simulacrum, a superficial image representing a non-existent original."
