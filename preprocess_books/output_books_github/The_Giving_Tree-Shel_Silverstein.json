    "text": " The Giving Tree is a tale about a relationship between a young boy and a tree. The tree always provides the boy with what he wants: branches on which to swing, shade in which to sit and apples to eat. As the boy grows older, he requires more and more of the tree. The tree loves the boy very much and gives him anything he asks for. In an ultimate act of self-sacrifice, the tree lets the boy cut it down so the boy can build a boat in which he can sail. The boy leaves the tree, now a stump. Many years later, the boy, now an old man, returns, and the tree sadly says: \"I'm sorry, boy... but I have nothing left to give you.\" But the boy replies: \"I do not need much now, just a quiet place to sit and rest.\" The tree then says, \"Well, an old tree stump is a good place for sitting and resting. Come, boy, sit down and rest.\" The boy obliges and the tree is very happy."
