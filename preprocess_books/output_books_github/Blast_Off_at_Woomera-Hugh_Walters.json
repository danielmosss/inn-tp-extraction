    "text": " Strange objects have been sighted on the moon near Mons Pico and suspecting a communist plot the British Government hurriedly plans a mission to photograph the domes from above closer range. The rocket is not large enough to send a man - enter Chris Godfrey, a 17-year old science whizz with an interest in rocketry and crucially less than 5 feet tall ! The launch site is Woomera Rocket Research Station in South Australia but there may be a Soviet traitor amongst the ground crew... The book pre-dates the first actual usage of satellite imagery by two years, and manned spaceflight by four years."
