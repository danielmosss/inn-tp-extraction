    "text": " The series is set in a stereotypical space opera world of the late XXI century. In Alisa's time people learned how to travel in space faster than light. Robots and aliens are common. Time travel is possible, but reserved only for scientific purposes. The society is a communist utopia: there's no need in money, environment is strictly protected and everything is done for the benefit of men. Alisa is a teenage Russian schoolgirl. Her father, Professor Seleznev, is a space biologist and director of Moscow CosmoZoo. The heroine is a curious fidget, she's interested in any sort of mystery, either scientistic or detective. In the stories, Alice, her friends, and occasionally her father, travel in space and time, explore distant planets, deal with aliens, fight space pirates and make scientistic discoveries. Many of the stories have ecological subtext. Alisa's family is modelled after that of the author: he actually had a daughter named Alisa, and heroine's parents are named after Bulychov himself and his wife."
