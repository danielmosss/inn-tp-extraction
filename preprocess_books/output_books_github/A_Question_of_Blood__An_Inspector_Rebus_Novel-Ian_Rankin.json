    "text": " At a private school two teenagers are killed by an ex-Army loner who then turns the gun on himself. As Detective Inspector John Rebus puts it, 'There's no mystery...except the why'. In searching for these answers, Rebus finds himself drawn into a shattered community and a link with his own past. He becomes fascinated with the killer who had friends and enemies aplenty, from politicians to goths, and who left behind a web of secrets and lies. Meanwhile, Rebus faces his own trials: DS Siobhan Clarke has been stalked by a petty criminal who is found burnt to death in his own home and Rebus is fresh out of hospital with his hands heavily bandaged. sv:Blodsband (roman)"
