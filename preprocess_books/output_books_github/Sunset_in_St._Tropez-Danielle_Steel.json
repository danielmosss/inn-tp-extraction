    "text": " Diana and Eric Morrison are a couple residing in a Central Park apartment in New York City who celebrate the new year with their friends: Pascale and John Donnally and Anne and Robert Smith. During their new year celebrations, they agree to go on a summer vacation together to St. Tropez. However, shortly after the new year, Robert's wife, Anne, suddenly dies - and Robert hesitates whether to join his friends on the planned summer vacation. After much persuasion, Robert agrees to accompany them, inviting a younger film actress to accompany him as his guest. At first, the actress is not accepted kindly by the women, although the men appear to take a liking to her. The plot analyzes forgiveness and the ability to move on throughout life, despite some of the circumstances the couples have endured."
