    "text": " The Family received attention due to its allegations that George W. Bush snorted cocaine with his brothers at Camp David during his father's presidency. One of Kelley's sources for the cocaine allegation was Neil Bush's ex-wife Sharon Bush, who has since denied telling Kelley the story. Kelley claims that Sharon Bush told her the story in front of a witness and has recanted due to pressure from the Bush family. The book also claims that in college Laura Bush was \"a go-to girl for dime bags of marijuana\", Barbara Bush objected to the fact that her son's girlfriend's stepfather was Jewish, and that at Harvard, George W. Bush objected to a classroom viewing of the film The Grapes of Wrath by asking \"Why are you going to show us that Commie movie?\", and saying \"Look. People are poor because they are lazy.\" Glynn Wilson, a free-lance journalist from Alabama, sued Kelley for plagiarism claiming passages from the book have the exact wording as his on-line article."
