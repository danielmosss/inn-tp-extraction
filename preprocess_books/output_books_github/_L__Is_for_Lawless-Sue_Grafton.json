    "text": " Kinsey is asked by her landlord Henry Pitts to help out Bucky, the grandson of their recently deceased neighbor Johnny Lee. Bucky is trying to ensure his grandfather has a military burial, but when Bucky submits a claim for his grandfather's death benefits, the military has no record of his grandfather. It appears that Johnny's past is not what it seems. Ray Rawson and Gilbert Hays, old acquaintances of Johnny Lee, turn up unexpectedly and are interested in the meager contents of Johnny's garage apartment. Events send Kinsey across the country in a wild search for the proceeds from a crime committed 40 years ago."
