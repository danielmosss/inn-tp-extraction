    "text": " Felix Nasmyth, the first person narrator, is a young man who, as he tells readers right at the beginning of the book, has \"always been a quitter.\" Without any hopes for the future, he is persuaded by one of his few friends to take part in a \"summer camp\"â€”a secluded rural area in Mendocino County, California-and grow marijuana on a large scale. The illegal business venture seems doomed from the start, but for once Nasmyth decides to prove something to himself and follow through. In the end, after many misadventures, the venture is a failure. At the same time Nasmyth has made the acquaintance of a lovely girl and has fallen in love with her. He ends his narrative on an optimistic note, returning to the girl with plans to \"plant a little seed.\""
