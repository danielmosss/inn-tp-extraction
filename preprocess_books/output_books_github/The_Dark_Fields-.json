    "text": " Eddie Spinola is a copywriter at a small publishing house in New York City. He starts using MDT-48, a fictional experimental drug granting heightened intellectual, creative, and learning powers, and enabling its user to see meaningful patterns in large amounts of disparate information. However, he experiences drug dependence and mental instability. On the run from police and creditors, facing death due to withdrawal from the drug, which he can no longer afford, his new career in high finance cut short by his increasingly erratic behavior, Eddie notices the President on television and recognizes the \"alert, gorged MDT expression in his eyes.\""
