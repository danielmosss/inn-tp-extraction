    "text": " Mr.Sampath, The Printer of Malgudi keeping with R.Ks novels has a very simple storyline. And as ever, R.K elevates the novel with his captivating characterization and scintillating story telling, not to forget his deft diction. There are a few business relations that demand two persons to work very closely that it may easily turn into an intimate bonding of hearts. A doctor and nurse, director and actor, opening batsmen in a cricket team, and so is that between an editor and a printer. To bring out the journal of Malgudi “The Banner”, Mr.Shrinivas, The Editor and Mr. Sampath, the Printer have to work together. The two entirely contrasting good hearted characters forge a great partnership that makes “The Banner” the cynosure of all eyes in Malgudi. However a situation arises that they have to temporarily discontinue the journal. Not two persons to lay idle, both of them join hands with a film making company where they have to trace varying paths, with their special bond still very deep. A love affair with the actress of the movie makes life difficult for the daring and over ambitious Sampath, while the ethnic and ethical Shrinivas has his problems of over responsibility too. Some sour incidents in the studio force Shrinivas to quit the studio and revive his banner with another printer, a thing that doesn't seem to bother Sampath caught entirely in the charm of the heroine. But Sampath comes back after the loss of the lady, loss of his family, loss of his wealth, loss of fame and loss of peace. The story ends in a gripping manner when he confides with his good old friend Shrinivas. And as you expect from R.K novel, you are only let out with a very heavy heart. hi:मिस्टर संपथ"
