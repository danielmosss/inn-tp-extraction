    "text": " Catherine is a 12-year-old girl. Her eight-year-old brother, David, has autism and Catherine explains how this makes her life complicated and causes her to wish that her life was a bit more \"normal\". She is compiling a list of rules for David so that he can understand how the world works. Despite her search for a normal life, she finds herself drawn into a friendship with wheelchair-bound Jason. His physical disability and her brother's mental disability combine to make her ashamed, especially of what her new neighbor Krista might think. Despite her fear, she struggles to do the right thing for everyone involved. She learns not to be scared to be afraid of what others think of her. All in all, she learns to deal with her brother and life."
