    "text": " The novel is written as a first-person narrative, the narrator being a young attorney from New York named John March. While investigating the disappearance of Evelyn Rand, a young heiress, March is transported across time and space. He finds himself on a strange world which is inhabited by bizarre tentacled creatures who claim to be the descendants of the human race. There he finds Evelyn Rand, abducted as he was, and the two become enamoured of each other. Also present are many historical people who disappeared mysteriously, including the poet Fran√ßois Villon, King Arthur, the lost Dauphin, John Orth of Austria, and the Prophet Elijah. The seven band together to confront their captors, demanding to know why they are there. Two chapters are devoted to an exposition of the history of the human race in evolutionary terms. Despite their technological prowess, the \"future men\" have lost certain human qualities - including love, loyalty and faith - which they now believe vital to their survival. They will stop at nothing to wrest these \"secrets\" from their abductees. Horrified by their inhumanity and ruthlessness, the seven vow to stop them at any cost. As the creatures suffer an attack by mindless monsters which they themselves created, John March and Evelyn Rand are transported back to 20th-century America. March decides to publish a record of their experiences in the hope of changing the direction of human civilization."
