    "text": " Everything on a Waffle, set in a small Canadian fishing village, tells the story of an eleven-year-old girl named Primrose Squarp. Primrose's parents disappear in a typhoon, but Primrose refuses to believe they are dead and doesn't attend their memorial service. While she defends her family's survival,her custody situation moves around from aging neighbor Miss Perfidy to her preoccupied Uncle Jack. The only thing that remains constant is her enjoyment of a restaurant called the Girl on the Red Swing, where each menu item is served on a waffle. Restaurant owner Kate Bowzer takes Primrose under her wing. She teaches her how to cook (recipes are all cited in a notepad) She doesn't question or criticize her, even through her odd predicaments, such as accidentally setting the class guinea pig on fire Primrose is taken from the custody of her uncle 'Uncle Jack' to an older couple. While she likes them, she is involved in a variety of accidents, including losing a toe. Through her oddities and accidents, Primrose becomes a town curiosity, with neighbors questioning her emotional state. But even through all of this, Primrose never gives up hope in finding her parents and being a normal family again.Later on, her parents come back, which is a real shock to everyone in town."
