    "text": " According to the book, Li witnessed Mao's private life on a day-to-day basis, mostly dealing with Mao at the height of his powers. Li alleged that Mao appeared anxious of the public but was indifferent to the problems of the Chinese people. It also describes Mao's signs of illness, paranoia, as well as neglecting dental hygiene (Mao's teeth were coated with a green-colored film, and when Li touched Mao's gums, pus oozed out). The book has two major focuses: * Mao's personal sexual history, including his sexual potence at the height of the revolution, and selection of numerous sexual partners following his adoption, at the age of 62, of the Taoist belief that frequent sex prolongs life. Despite his initial fascination for and admiration of Mao, Li expresses his growing disgust and contempt for Mao beginning at this point due to the leader's hypocritical assertion that the population at large must adopt a sexually conservative lifestyle. * The political intrigue within Communist Party leadership, including Mao's excessive use of propaganda and unrealistic demands leading to absurdities such as putting rice fields near railroad tracks to give the impression of fertility and health while the country suffered from massive famine, as well as Mao's excitement after President Richard Nixon's visit to China, around the time his health started to deteriorate. Li also writes about his personal experiences, the effects of the Cultural Revolution on his family, and his life as a doctor for 22 years in Mao's life."
