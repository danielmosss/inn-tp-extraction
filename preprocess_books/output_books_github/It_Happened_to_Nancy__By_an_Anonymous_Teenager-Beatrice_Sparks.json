    "text": " Nancy is a fourteen-year-old girl who just wants to have fun while at a Garth Brooks concert with her friends. While there she has an asthma attack and an eighteen-year old boy named Collin helps her. He takes her outside and tells her to relax. From that day on she starts talking to him every day after school. One night, she invites him to her house when her mother is not home, and he rapes her in her mother's bed. After that night, when she begins to look for Collin, it turns out that he does not study in the college he told her. She begins feeling sick later on, and easily exhausted. Then one day, when her mother takes her to the doctor, she has blood samples taken. She then learns that she has HIV and doesn't know what to do; she just wants to die and feels that she doesn't have anything on earth for her. She decides she wants to find Collin and have him go to jail for raping her. She describes his appearance to the police. Her closest friends do not know what is wrong with her, thinking her father is sick and that she has gone to Arizona because of it. She does not want to tell them that she was raped by a boy who she thought was the love of her life. While at school most of her fellow students do not know that she has HIV, but her friends support her the whole way. Nancy and her parents become closer even though her parents are divorced. Later she dies and wishes for her diary to be published so that other young teenagers like her can know the real truth."
