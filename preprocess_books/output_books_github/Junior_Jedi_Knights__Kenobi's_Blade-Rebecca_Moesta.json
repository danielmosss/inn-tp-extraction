    "text": " Uldir, a classmate of Anakin Solo's at the Jedi Academy on Yavin 4, wished to become a great Jedi, but his skills in the Force are weak, such that he can't even lift a feather with his mind. He gets the idea to use a Holocron to learn the secrets of the Jedi of the Old Republic. He \"borrows\" the Holocron along with Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber, recovered from Darth Vader's palace on the planet Vjun where the Dark Lord took it after striking down his old master on the first Death Star. Apparently, Obi-Wan's lightsaber grants its wielder skill in Form III of lightsaber combat, of which Kenobi was a master. Anakin—along with his friends Tahiri Veila, R2-D2, Tionne and the Jedi Master Ikrit—must race across the galaxy to find Uldir. If they don't find and stop Uldir, he could very well be killed, and Kenobi's blade and the Holocron could fall into the hands of a very evil man."
