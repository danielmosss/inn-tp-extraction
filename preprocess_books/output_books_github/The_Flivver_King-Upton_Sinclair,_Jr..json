    "text": " On Bagley Street in the city of Detroit, Little Abner Shutt begins the story by explaining to his mother that \"there's a feller down the street says he's goin' to make a wagon that'll run without a horse.\" The man is Henry Ford. The story follows the progress and growth of Ford Motor Company through the perspective of a number of generations of a single family. \"The Flivver King\" demonstrates the effects of Scientific Management in factories. The Ford factory began with very skilled workers. Through a process of breaking the skilled job down into simple steps, they were able to hire lower wage, less skilled individuals to do the work. The Flivver King explains how the Ford Company used scientific management to replace skilled workers while successfully increasing production."
