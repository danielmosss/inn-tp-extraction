    "text": " The introduction, with instructions that the Dungeon Master read it aloud to the players, outlines that there is a treasure in the Yatil Mountains south of the Greyhawk realm of Perrenland. The player characters must investigate rumors of a lost treasure that scores of adventurers have perished attempting to find. The players must first traverse a wilderness area with 20 numbered encounters before arriving at the caverns. The encounters have names such as \"Border Patrol\" (encounter 1) and \"Hill Giants\" (encounter 10). After the wilderness are two lettered encounters: the \"Gnome Vale\", which includes a map for their lair, and \"The Craggy Dells\", where humans and orcs are capturing hippogriffs to sell. Next, the player characters reach the caverns. They consist of the \"Lesser Caverns\" with 22 encounters, and the \"Greater Caverns\" with 20 encounters, each with its own map. The lesser caverns include encounters such as \"Stinking Cave\" (encounter 5) which contains four trolls and \"Underground Lake\" (encounter 14). The greater caverns include encounters such as \"Uneven-Floored Cavern\" (encounter 5) where the player characters face an umber hulk and \"Canyon of Centaurs\" (encounter 9). The 20th and final encounter is titled \"The Inner Sphere\". Here, a \"woman sleeps on an alabaster slab.\" She is \"armored from toe to neck in gold chased plate mail.\" The woman is actually Drelzna, a fighter/vampire and the daughter of Iggwilv. After defeating Drelzna, the players are rewarded with treasure, and the adventure ends."
