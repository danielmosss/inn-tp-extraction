    "text": " Set in the early 1990s, it concerns a historian and teacher, Alfred Clayton, and his response to a national survey requesting \"memories and impressions\" of the administration of Gerald Ford. The novel is presented as Clayton's improbably long and incredibly personal response, submitted to his professional association, the Northern New England Association of American Historians (NNEAAH). (Clayton teaches at a junior college in New Hampshire.)"
