    "text": " An amnesic blonde girl appears in the middle of traffic on a busy day. Carol and Paul, a married couple, are drawn to her, seeing her as the child they never had, they take her in. Then the hauntings begin- ghastly noises in the dead of night, a bloody face in the mirror,and the razor sharp ax. Where has Jane come from? Is she just an orphan in need of love? Or is she hiding something more sinister? Who is the girl behind the mask?"
