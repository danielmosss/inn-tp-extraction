    "text": " When Chief Inspector Reg Wexford takes a holiday to China, takes in the Great Wall, the Forbidden Palace, he doesn't expect his trip to revisit him in such a horrific way. Shortly after his return, he finds out that one of his fellow tourists from the trip has been killed in her home. A burglary, it seems like, but Wexford has other ideas."
