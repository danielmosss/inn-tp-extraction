Since then, Fred has been passing her days by working at the aquarium and being annoyed by Jonas (her best friend) and Dr. Barb's (her boss) relationship. They have been setting Fred up on various blind dates as well, which have all ended badly. Fred is surprised to discover two Undersea Folk requesting her presence at the Pelagic.
