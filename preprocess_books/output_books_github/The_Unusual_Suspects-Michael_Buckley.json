    "text": " Sabrina and Daphne are off to school, but when Sabrina's teacher, Mr. Grumpner, is murdered, with a scarlet handprint left on the chalkboard (the sign of the Scarlet Hand), they realize that something is very odd. With the help of Puck and Wendell, the son of the Pied Piper of Hamelin; who is also the principal of their school, they search the school's halls for clues, finally coming upon a shocking secret and a deadly encounter with the children of some very famous fairy-tale characters and the monstrous Rumpelstiltskin, who has been discovered by one of their ancestors to have the ability to act like a bomb. Sabrina and Daphne discover a cave under school using matches that Mayor Charming gave them to take them wherever they needed, where she finds her family and friends trapped in a web where they would be soon suffocated to death when Rumpelstiltskin would have the power (which he gets from strong feelings such as anger) to blow up the entire cave so they could escape from a magical barrier trapping the Everafters in the city, but which isn't as strong deep underground. Sabrina, while defeating Rumpelstiltskin and his supporters, discovers that the plotters are part of a secret Everafter organization called the Scarlet Hand, who had killed Grumpner and kidnapped her parents. Sabrina, after saving the trapped people, goes to a ruins of a hospital using the matches and comes face to face with the kidnapper of her parents who is a mentally imbalanced girl, although the kidnapper's face was hidden under a hood. Book 2 ends here, but the scene continues on in Book 3."
