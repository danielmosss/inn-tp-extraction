    "text": " 11-year-old George and his older brother Jack move with their mother to Whitby, Ontario in the summer of 1943. In Whitby they discover a spy training camp called Camp X. They are caught and sign a secrecy oath which means they cannot tell anyone about anything in the camp. The campâ€™s leader spots them when they are trying to sneak in and gives them a job sneaking around to improve security, in Camp X as well as the nearby munitions factory, Defence Industries Limited. They learn much about the camp and are sent off with tasks. When delivering newspapers one day they are caught by German agents. Jack and George are tortured and almost killed, but they figure out a lot about the Germans. They get away and warn the Camp X of the attacks that are planned. They risk their lives to warn Camp X, and are proud about their success."
