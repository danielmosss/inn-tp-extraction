    "text": " The narrator, \"Binder\" (his radio codename), is asked by the \"Rum Doodle Committee\" and its chairman, \"Sir Hugeley Havering,\" to lead an expedition to climb \"Rum Doodle\", the highest mountain in the world (with an elevation of 40,000 and 1/2 feet), in the remote (fictional) country of \"Yogistan\". He assembles a team of climbers to play all the roles seen in the parodied literature: * Burley, the \"strong man\"; * Constant, the \"linguist\"; * Jungle, the \"route finder\"; * Prone, the \"physician\"; * Shute, the \"photographer\"; * Wish, the \"scientist.\" It rapidly develops that each of the climbers is utterly inept in his nominal field of competence, as they demonstrate in a series of chaotic adventures en route to Yogistan; for example, Prone endures a never-ending series of illnesses, while Constant mispronounces a Yogistani word (the language hinges on variously \"pronounced\" belches and gastrointestinal rumbles) and offends a \"short but powerful\" Yogistani wielding a knife, having informed him that he lusted for the man's wife — not his intention at all. Binder handles these mishaps with typically British aplomb, having been reassured by the expedition's sponsor that \"to climb Mont Blanc by the Grépon route is one thing; to climb Rum Doodle is, as Totter once said, quite another.\" Somehow the group does make it to Yogistan, where they hire Yogistani porters, parodies of the Sherpas who were the indispensable indigenous porters and mountain guides (and sometimes climbing partners) to many of the great mountaineering expeditions. However, the Yogistanis do not share the invariable positive attributes of the Sherpa — quite the contrary. Hijinks ensue, as the expedition cook, \"Pong\", produces food so inedible that the expedition tries (unsuccessfully) to continue on up the mountain without him; the inevitable fall into a crevasse leads to the consumption of the party's champagne (brought along to celebrate reaching the summit and for \"medicinal purposes\") during the rescue attempt; and scientist Wish embarks on a never-ending quest for \"Wharton's warple\", an endangered species indigenous to the mountains. Eventually, Binder and a colleague manage to stumble to the top of the lofty spire the group has been approaching ... only to find that they have climbed the wrong mountain (and to see the porters, with Prone in tow, climbing the right one)."
