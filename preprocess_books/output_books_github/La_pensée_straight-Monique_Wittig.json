    "text": " \"One Is Not Born a Woman,\" follows in the wake of Simone de Beauvoir's feminist political visions. Wittig writes, 'Lesbians are not women', under the assumption that the term 'woman' is defined by men. Moreover, she compares lesbians to fugitive slaves. \"The Trojan Horse,\" explains her theory of literature as a \"war machine\", echoing Gilles Deleuze."
