    "text": " This is a novel about the source of a mysterious 40 million pound legacy. The main benefactor was a small college in the remote Rift Valley in Kenya. The heirs were the South African man Dirk Hendricks and the unknown, recently discovered, descendant, Henry Hendrix from California. Max Stafford, security consultant, is suspicious of Henry being an impostor and the violent reaction to his arrival in Kenya points to a sinister and far-reaching conspiracy far beyond mere greed."
