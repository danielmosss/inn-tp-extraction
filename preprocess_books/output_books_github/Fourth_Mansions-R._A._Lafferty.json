    "text": " Fourth Mansions was inspired by Teresa of √Åvila's Interior Castle, and contains quotations from the book, which quotations Lafferty uses as chapter headings. The Interior Castle is a metaphor for an individual's soul; its different rooms, different states of the soul. In the middle of the Castle the soul is in the purest state, which equals Heaven. Lafferty uses more complex symbols in telling a many-sided tale of an individual's reaching towards Heaven or Truth. The novel concerns a time of great change, when four forces - in the form of secret societies - contend to control the next phase of humanity's history. In the middle is Fred Foley, an innocent reporter. One of these forces intends to unleash a deadly virus on the USA, the others attempt to stop them. A revolution by Mexican migrants, the craft of \"mind weaving\" and a strange group of \"Patricks\", all apparently tramps but with great resources, appear in the center of a narrative."
