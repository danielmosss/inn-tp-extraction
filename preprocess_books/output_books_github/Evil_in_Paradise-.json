    "text": " Richard Duffy and his nephew went to Hawaii in answer to a call for help from Jade Munroe, an old friend of Richard's from his days as an adventurer. Arriving in Jade's hideout, they found themselves held at gun point by her. Barely escaping back to their hotel, they narrowly evaded poisonous snakes in their room and discovered Richard's old nemesis, the Shark, was not only alive, but also back in town with a new game of providing new faces and identities for criminals. However, they soon learned that they were dealing with a much more shrewd mastermind than the Shark ... the Mole, possessor of the only other Kronom K-D2 in the world."
