He calls on the Hardy Boys to solve the mystery of the theft of two valuable oil paintings in the area of Millwood. The Hardy Boys accept the proposal and go along with Chet to the Millwood school. In the school, they meet a millionaire - Mr. Davenport. A fort, known as Senandaga, is believed to be haunted and the Hardy Boys think that the Haunted fort may have something to do with the theft of the paintings. The Hardy Boys and Chet are told that Mr. Davenport's ancestor, known as the prisoner-painter was held prisoner in Senandaga and he made 17 paintings of the outside view of Senandaga. Out of seventeen, 3 have been stolen. It is believed that a treasure, which contains a chain of solid gold is hidden in the fort, the clue to find them is in the paintings of the prisoner-painter. The Hardy Boys investigate the case. Many times, their car, boat and jeeps are sabotaged, usually in with the intent to kill them. But, the Hardy Boys escape every time.
