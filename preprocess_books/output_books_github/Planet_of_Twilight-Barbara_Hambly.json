    "text": " The story takes place on Nam Chorios, a backwater world in the Outer Rim which infamously was the center of the Death Seed Plague centuries ago. It is now home to a fanatic religious cult which is plotting to use a new weapon system of quasi-intelligent crystals as unstoppable, unmanned starfighters to attack the New Republic. Leia Organa Solo unofficially goes on a trip to meet with Seti Ashgad, the leader of the Rationalist Party. Luke Skywalker is there after receiving a message from Callista, an old flame. Luke's ship is shot down and Leia is kidnapped by the ancient and corrupt Beldorion the Hutt. After a series of adventures the two escape and end the political conspiracy between the Rationalists and the New Republic."
