    "text": " Now one old Wells friend, Nora, that noisy mouse, returns with all her middle-child problems still on display. What's a mouse to do when little brother and big sister take up all mom and dad's time? Yup. Plenty of noise. Look at these new pictures and you can almost hear the racket. With all that clatter, it might be better to read this one before dinner, not before bed!"
