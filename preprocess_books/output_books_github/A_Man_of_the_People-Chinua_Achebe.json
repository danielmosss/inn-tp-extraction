    "text": " A Man of the People is a first-person account of Odili, a school teacher in a fictional country closely resembling post-colonial Nigeria. Odili receives an invitation from a former teacher of his, Chief Nanga, who is now the powerful but corrupt Minister of Culture. As Minister, Nanga's job is to protect the traditions of his country, and though he is known as \"A Man of the People,\" he instead uses his position to increase his personal wealth. The Minister's riches and power prove particularly impressive to Odili's girlfriend, who cheats on him with the minister. Seeking revenge, Odili begins to pursue the minister's fiancee. Odili agrees to lead an opposition party in the face of both bribes and violent threats. Odili triumphs over the Minister, however, when a military coup forces his old teacher from office. The book ends with the line: \"you died a good death if your life had inspired someone to come forward and shoot your murderer in the chest -- without asking to be paid.\""
