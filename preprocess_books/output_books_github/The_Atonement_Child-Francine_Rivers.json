    "text": " Dynah is a young Christian college girl at a bible college when rape shatters her life, and then the resulting pregnancy may shatter her faith. As her pro-life fiance suddenly finds abortion acceptable, and her pro-life school informs her that she will be expelled unless her pregnancy disappears, she is forced to wonder about their views of the World and what God has said in the Bible and of her own former pro-life views. At home she finds her family torn apart as her mother admits to an abortion before she had Dynah that made her incapable of having children for several years, and her grandmother admits to an abortion that was forced on her for \"health reasons\". Dynah is eventually driven to isolate herself so that she can make the decision on her own. As her mother's \"Atonement Child\", Dynah must come to the decision on whether or not to have her own \"Atonement Child\"."
