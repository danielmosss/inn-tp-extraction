    "text": " In the backwoods southern town of Rockwood, a vampire and a werewolf in a run-down old truck come across Gil's All Night Diner, a 24-hour restaurant in the middle of nowhere. Nearly run out of gas, they stop in at the diner only to discover it is the target of zombie attacks, hauntings, and occult activity. The manager of the diner, Loretta, offers them a job helping her out around the diner, and maybe help solve her zombie problem. In exchange, she'll give them money to help them on their way. They accept."
