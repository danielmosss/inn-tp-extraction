    "text": " Stephen is a 17 year old foster child living on the edge of the law. He has moved from family to family, all the time guarding a great secret. He harbors a huge crocodilan beast, ferocious from birth, bequeathed to him by his criminal father when Stephen was a child. Beast tells the story of his murderous intents toward this monster and his growing relationships, as well as frequently reliving his childhood through flashbacks."
