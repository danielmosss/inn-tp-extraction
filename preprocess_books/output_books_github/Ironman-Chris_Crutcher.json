    "text": " The story takes place in Spokane, Washington where Beauregard Brewster (Bo) lives with his mother and younger brother Jordan. Motivated by years of fishing with his father and a recent dispute with Coach Redmond, Bo’s football coach and English teacher, the teenager trains vigorously for the Yukon Jack Ironman Triathlon. Along the way Bo is forced to enroll in the school’s anger management program, where much to his surprise he meets a wise old shop teacher and a group of supposed delinquents who inspire and support him further in his efforts."
