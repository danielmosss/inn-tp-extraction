    "text": " Frank Machianno, a retired San Diego mafia hitman, cut his ties with the mafia many years ago. However, one day, his past catches up with him as the boss of Los Angeles family calls in for a past favor. Frank must oversee a meeting between the Detroit Combination and the Los Angeles crime family. Unfortunately, the meeting is revealed to be a \"set-up\", a scheme to kill Frankie. Someone from Frank's past wants him dead, and Frank has to find out why, how, and when. The problem is that the list of candidates is about the size of a phone book, and Frankie is rapidly running out of time."
