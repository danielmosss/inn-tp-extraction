    "text": " The book’s central plot concerns a plan to liberate all the animals from the Vienna Zoo, as happened just after the conclusion of World War II. Irving’s two protagonists—Graff, a young Austrian college student, and Siggy, an eccentric motorcycle mechanic-cum-philosopher—meet and embark on an adventure-filled motorcycle tour of Austria before the novel’s climax: \"the great zoo bust\". Towards the middle of the book the two protagonists go their separate ways and a large section of the novel is given over to “The Notebook”—a chronicle of the Siggy character’s family from pre-WWII, through the occupation of the Soviets, to the late 1960s. Siggy is killed in a motorcycle accident, the grief-stricken Graff then continues with their plan to free the inhabitants of the Vienna Zoo with Siggy's voice echoing in his head. This ends in catastrophic results. de:Laßt die Bären los! fr:Liberté pour les ours ! pl:Uwolnić niedźwiedzie"
