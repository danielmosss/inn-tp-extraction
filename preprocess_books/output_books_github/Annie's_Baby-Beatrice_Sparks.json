    "text": " The book is about a fourteen-year-old girl, Annie, who falls in love with a boy named Danny. She soon becomes the victim of domestic violence, along with rape. Not long after the two start dating, she finds out she is pregnant. Annie and her mother are left to decide what will become of the baby. At first, Annie tries to keep the baby, who is called \"Little Annie,\" but soon finds it too difficult and gives her up for adoption. The book ends with the words \"Annie loves Danny,\" meaning that Annie had to remember her very first love. There are inconsistencies in the book that support the theory that Beatrice Sparks fabricated the diary. On the first page, Annie remarks, \"This morning I... threw a last minute polish on my (due-yesterday) science paper...\" However, the entry is written on a Monday. As school never operates regularly on weekends, this would have been impossible. At the end of the novel, Annie mentions that she drew a heart with the words \"Annie loves Danny\" on a tree on the day of their first meeting; however, Annie did not learn Danny's name until their second meeting. Whether this is a true story is still unclear."
