    "text": " Nietzsche criticizes German culture of the day as unsophisticated and nihilistic, and shoots some disapproving arrows at key French, British, and Italian cultural figures who represent similar tendencies. In contrast to all these alleged representatives of cultural \"decadence\", Nietzsche applauds Caesar, Napoleon, Goethe, Thucydides and the Sophists as healthier and stronger types. The book states the transvaluation of all values as Nietzsche's final and most important project, and gives a view of antiquity wherein the Romans for once take precedence over the ancient Greeks. The book is divided up into several sections: ===Maxims and Arrow he Problem of Socrate eason in Philosoph ow the \"True World\" Finally Became Fictio orality as Anti-Natur he Four Great Errors=== In the chapter The Four Great Errors, he suggests that people, especially Christians, confuse the effect for the cause, and that they project the human ego and subjectivity on to other things, thereby creating the illusionary concept of being, and therefore also of the thing-in-itself and God. In reality, motive or intention is \"an accompaniment to an act\" rather than the cause of that act. By removing causal agency based on free, conscious will, Nietzsche critiques the ethics of accountability, suggesting that everything is necessary in a whole that can neither be judged nor condemned, because there is nothing outside of it. What people typically deem \"vice\" is in fact merely \"the inability not to react to a stimulus.\" In this light, the concept of morality becomes purely a means of control: \"the doctrine of will has been invented essentially for the purpose of punishment, that is of finding guilty.\""
