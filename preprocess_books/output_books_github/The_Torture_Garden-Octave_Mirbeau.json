    "text": " Published at the height of the Dreyfus Affair, Mirbeauâ€™s novel is a loosely assembled reworking of texts composed at different eras, featuring different styles, and showcasing different characters. Beginning with material stemming from articles on the 'Law of Murder' discussed in the \"Frontispice\" (\"The Manuscript\"), the novel continues with a farcical critique of French politics as seen in \"En Mission\" : a French politicians' aide is sent on a pseudo-scientific expedition to China, while his presence at home would be compromising (\"The Mission\"). Then it moves on to an account of a visit to a Cantonese prison by a narrator accompanied by the sadist/hysteric Clara, who delights in witnessing flayings, crucifixions and numerous tortures, all done in beautifully laid out and groomed gardens, and explaining the beauty of torture to her companion. Finally she attains hysterical orgasm and passes out in exhaustion, only to begin again a few days later (\"Le Jardin des supplices\", \"The Garden\")."
