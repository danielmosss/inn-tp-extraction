    "text": " The Gospel presents the tenets of Pastafarianism—often satires of creationism—elaborating on the \"beliefs\" established in the open letter. Furthermore, Henderson discusses the original Pastafarian \"belief\" that the decline in the number of pirates, who are revered by Pastafarians, has directly led to a rise in global temperature. He provides further \"evidence\" of this relationship with the observation \"that many people dress up as pirates for Halloween, and the months following October 31 are generally cooler than those that precede it.\" The claim that declining numbers of pirates have resulted in rising temperatures is meant to demonstrate that correlation does not imply causation. The book urges readers to try Pastafarianism for 30 days, saying, \"If you don't like us, your old religion will most likely take you back.\" Henderson states on his website that more than 100,000 copies of the book have been sold. The Gospel begins with the creation of the universe by an invisible and undetectable Flying Spaghetti Monster. Between drunken nights and clumsy afternoons, the Flying Spaghetti Monster produced seas and land (for a second time, accidentally, because he forgot that he created it the day before) along with Heaven and a midget, which he named Man. Man and an equally short woman lived happily in the Olive Garden of Eden for some time until the Flying Spaghetti Monster caused a global flood in a cooking accident. This creation, \"claimed\" by Pastafarians to be only 5,000 years ago, would be considered laughable by many scientists. In addition to parodying certain biblical literalists, Henderson uses this unorthodox method to lampoon intelligent design proponents, who he believes first \"define [their] conclusion and then gather evidence to support it\". The book contains the Eight \"I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts\", adherence to which enables Pastafarians to ascend to heaven, which includes a stripper factory and beer volcano. According to The Gospel, Mosey the Pirate captain received ten stone tablets as advice from the Flying Spaghetti Monster. Of these original ten \"I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts\", two were dropped on the way down from Mount Salsa. This event \"partly accounts for Pastafarians' flimsy moral standards.\" The \"I'd Really Rather You Didn'ts\" address a broad array of behavior, from sexual conduct to nutrition. One reviewer commented that this parody of the Ten Commandments \"reads like a bitter shopping list of the same criticisms\" given to organized religions. One commandment is \"I'd really rather you didn't build multimillion-dollar synagogues / churches / temples / mosques / shrines to [His] Noodly Goodness when the money could be better spent ending poverty, curing diseases, living in peace, loving with passion and lowering the cost of cable.\""
