    "text": " This book is written in the perspective of Rachel Robinson, who is an overachiever and a perfectionist. She tries to help her older sister, Jessica, with her acne problem. She resents her older brother, Charles, who has been expelled from boarding school. Rachel feels Charles gets all the attention in her family, even if it is negative, and that he is driving their parents to the break of despair,(and is gorgeous in the sight of girls). In the book, Rachel has to deal with her crush on Charles's tutor, Paul Mediros,(who in the end dates their cousin Tarren) and the fact that the best looking boy in ninth grade, Jeremy \"Dragon\" Kravitz (at least, to Stephanie, Allison and Rachel) is interested in her, (who in the end kisses her). Through family counseling and a trip to Ellis Island, the Robinson family learn how to put aside their differences and get along better."
