    "text": " Ida B. Applewood is a homeschooled only child who enjoys long conversations with the apple trees in her family's orchard. Her life changes when her mother develops cancer, leading her parents to sell part of the orchard and send Ida B to public school. She first acts terrible around her teacher, Ms. Washington, because of a previous experience in school. She later learns however that public school—Ms. Washington included—isn't that bad. She also learns along the way that she should learn to say she's sorry, accept the truth, and believe in herself."
