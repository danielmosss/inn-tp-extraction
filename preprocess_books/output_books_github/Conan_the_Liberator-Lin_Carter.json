    "text": " Following the events of the story \"The Treasure of Tranicos\", Conan joins a conspiracy of former comrades-in-arms to overthrow Numedides, the mad and tyrannical king of Aquilonia. As commander of the rebel forces, he has the prospect of becoming king himself if they succeed, but he has not only Numedides' loyal troops, led by General Procas, to overcome, but the spells of the evil sorcerer Thulandra Thuu. Chronologically, Conan the Liberator overlaps the events of the story \"Wolves Beyond the Border\", and is followed by the story \"The Phoenix on the Sword\"."
