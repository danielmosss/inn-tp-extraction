    "text": " Junka Nimura, a young girl who lives with her mother and her grandmother, is the main character. Her father, who has left her mother, is Junichiro Tokuoka (one of the main characters in .hack//Liminality), and Junka never knew him. In The World Junka plays the female Heavy Axeman named \"Carl\". She's been playing the game for quite a long time, and likes to cause trouble, like cheating and PK-ing. Her favourite place is the cathedral at \"Hidden Forbidden Holy Ground\". One day, she meets Sora, and she seems to like his attitude, but every time they meet, something strange happens to him: he starts screaming and the game goes haywire. As the story progress, Aura appears, and Carl views her as the cause of Sora's pain and attacks her, at which point the entire game seems to crash. Meanwhile, Junka's grandmother, Takie, begins to notice about the effect the game is having on her granddaughter's life. She expresses her concerns to Kyouko, Junka's mother, telling her that Junka needs a father figure. Back in The World, Orca and Balmung are investigating the strange incidents that have been occurring recently. Orca tells having spotted a strange cat-like PC sitting in town playing with aromatic grass. In another place Junka meets her friend Alph, and tells her about Aura. Later Alph contacts Balmung and Orca. When Sora no longer appears before Carl, she gets desperate, and posts a weird message about Sora on the BBS. This message reaches Mariko Misono (Subaru's player), who logs into The World for the first time since the events in .hack//Sign. Carl meets Subaru wanting to learn more about Sora. Subaru tells her that Aura isn't evil; just a very young child who can't yet control the power she holds, and tells her about An Shouji (Tsukasa's player). Carl doesn't understand Subaru and eventually walks away in irritation. Alph is worried about Carl's behavior; she thinks Carl may be punished for cheating and PK-ing. So she introduces her to one of her friends, Sieg, who tries to talk some sense into Carl, but has little success. Back in the cathedral, Carl meets Sora again. He attacks her, giving her blows that feel real to Junka. Carl believes that Sora has forgotten her and she surrenders, waiting for him to PK her. At this point Aura appears, and Sora goes through some sort of transformation and fires energy at her. Carl is surprised that Aura doesn't try to defend herself, and asks the girl what she is doing there, and the injured Aura replies that she is there because \"Hurting Sora would make Carl sad\". Sora stops his attack when Carl calls out his name, and he finally manages to say her name. Carl is really happy, and when Sora is about to continue his attack, she grabs Aura and flees the cathedral with her. Aside from giving their names, the tenth chapter (RE: 2000) is primarily focused on telling about An Shouji's life after the events in .hack//Sign and her relationship with Mariko Misono, from Mariko's perspective. An takes Bear's suggestion and goes to study at a boarding school. Because of this she and Mariko can't see each other as much as they want, but they talk on the phone and write letters all the time. The chapter also has Mariko thinking back to their second date,The actual word is \"ouse\" (逢瀬), which translates to: tryst; (lover's) meeting; (secret) date. Translation retrieved from Jim Breen's WWWJDIC Japanese-English Dictionary Server on December 8, 2006. with a description of how the two talk while An rests her head on Mariko's lap, with Mariko stroking her hair."
