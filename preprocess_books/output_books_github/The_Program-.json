Rackley must rescue the daughter of a Hollywood producer from a dangerous mind control cult, by infiltrating the group. Charismatic leader TD Betters had created his own society based on self-help tenets, and Rackley must navigate through it without getting pulled in himself. The novel describes a fictional large group awareness training called \"The Program\", In the novel, the seminar leader had \"married two cult models\", which one of the protagonists describes as a blend of the \"psychotherapeutic cult\", and the \"self-improvement cult\". The character then tells his friend that \"The Program\", is similar to a combination of the Sullivanians and Lifespring. Werner Erhard is quoted, prior to the opening of the prologue."
