    "text": " It is embarrassing enough that Carlos Amoroso is 15 years old and never even kissed a girl, but the object of his desire, Roxy Rodriguez — who is popular and gorgeous — has no idea that Carlos is even alive. After watching a television show about gay guys making over a straight guy, Carlos gets an idea: What if he got a makeover from Sal, the guy at school who everyone thinks is gay? Asking Sal to do him a favor is harder than it seems, because Carlos is worried that if any of his friends see him hanging out with Sal, they will think he is gay too. And in return for making Carlos over, Sal wants help starting a Gay-Straight Alliance at their school—not exactly something Carlos is dying to do. But over the course of the makeover, Carlos learns about life and love, and finally starts to \"get it.\""
