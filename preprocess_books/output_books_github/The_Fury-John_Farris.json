    "text": " Gillian Bellaver is a teenage girl who has psychic powers such as telepathy and telekinesis. But though she is trying to reject the fact that she is clairvoyant, she soon finds out that a boy her age, Robin Sandza, is kidnapped. With her powers, she helps Robin's father Peter Sandza find Robin. But though Robin was psychic like Gillian, they come to realize death has entered their boundaries. Gillian and Peter find Robin, but both father and son get killed. Gillian wakes up to find she is kidnapped, a victim herself, when the kidnapper, Childermass, has her in a room. She grabs a winter coat and drowns him mercilessly."
