    "text": " In this book set during the Napoleonic Wars, Sharpe repeatedly runs into problems caused by his lower social class and his officer standing. This is the only book in the series to be set in England (though in the Television series a second was produced - Sharpe's Justice) and involves Sharpe looking for the missing Second Battalion of the South Essex Regiment which he needs to reinforce the dwindling First Battalion in Spain. The story also involves Sharpe and Harper having to rejoin the South Essex as recruits to find the missing men."
