    "text": " Charity Selborne is on holiday in Provence with her friend, and former colleague, Louise. Before her marriage to Johnny Selborne they both taught at the same school in the West Midlands. Charity is now a widow; her husband's plane was shot down in France during the War. She is staying at the same hotel as David Shelley and his stepmother, Loraine Bristol. Mrs. Bristol has taken David to France from England. David's father, Richard Byron, an antique dealer, who has been accused of murder, is pursuing his son across France. Also staying at the hotel are John Marsden who is English and reads T. S. Eliot at breakfast and Paul VÃ©ry, who is French. Both have parts to play in subsequent events."
