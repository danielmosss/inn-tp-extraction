    "text": " At the centre of the Milky Way galaxy an object called the Void resembles a massive black hole. The Void is not a natural system. Inside there is a strange universe where the laws of physics are very different to those we know. It is slowly consuming the other stars of the galactic core - one day it will have devoured the entire galaxy. In AD 3589 a human has started to dream of the wonderful existence inside the Void. He has a following of millions of believers. They now wish to make a pilgrimage to the Void to live the life they have been shown. Other star-faring species fear their migration will cause the Void to expand again. They are prepared to stop the pilgrimage fleet no matter what the cost."
