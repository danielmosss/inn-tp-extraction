    "text": " Something ominous is happening in Glastonbury. Two mysterious deaths and the women of the town are falling ill. Could the strange crow dolls appearing in their houses be involved? Back in London, Neil Chapman living in the Wyrd Museum (a strange building owned by the three mysterious Webster sisters) once more enters the 'Separate Collection,' and discovers a stuffed raven that has come back to life. Then one of the Webster sisters go missing, along with Edie Dorkins, the elfin girl brought out of the past to carry on the sisters' work. What has called Miss Veronica away from the safe-haven of the museum? A memory of a past life and a lost love, enough to risk her life and the destruction of her sisters and the powerful secrets they keep. Will Neil get there in time to save the women of Glastonbury from a terrible fate, and to save the Websters from the great Battle that is coming?"
