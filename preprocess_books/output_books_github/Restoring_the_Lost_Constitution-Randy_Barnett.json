    "text": " Restoring the Lost Constitution is broken into four parts, each addressing an aspect of the U.S. Constitution. # Constitutional Legitimacy describes the most common arguments for constitutional legitimacy, and argues against them in practical terms. Barnett suggests that in practice it is impossible for any constitution to derive its legitimacy from consent, but it must rather derive legitimacy through \"necessity\" and \"propriety\". # Constitutional Method # Constitutional Limits # Constitutional Powers"
