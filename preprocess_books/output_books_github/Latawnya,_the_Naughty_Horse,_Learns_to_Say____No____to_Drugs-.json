    "text": " The plot mainly deals with the title character, Latawnya, the youngest horse in her family. While out playing with her sisters Latoya and Daisy, they come across some other mares: Connie, Chrystal, Jackie and Angie. They ask Latawnya if she wants to engage in \"smoking games\" and \"drinking games\". Latawnya realizes that they want to smoke drugs and drink alcohol, and she joins in. Her sisters catch her with the three \"bad\" horses and proceed to criticize her for \"smoking drugs and drinking\", something that their parents tell them not to do. Although Latawnya begs Latoya and Daisy not to tell their parents, they tell on her anyway, resulting in an uncomfortable confrontation with them, as they are disappointed in her experimenting with smoking drugs and drinking. After an intense lecture from her parents (including a scene wherein an old friend of the father horse suffers an overdose after engaging in smoking games and drinking games), Latawnya realizes the error of her ways and promises never to engage in \"smoking games\" and \"drinking games\" again."
