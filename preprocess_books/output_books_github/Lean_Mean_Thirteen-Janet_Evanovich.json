    "text": " Stephanie Plum is reunited yet again with her lawyer ex-husband, Dickie Orr, while doing a favour for Ranger. When Dickie is later discovered missing from his apartment under some rather violent circumstances, Stephanie becomes the prime suspect in his apparent murder. While trying to prove her innocence she and Ranger uncover Dickie's ties to the partners in his law firm, who appear to be involved in everything from money laundering to drug running. Dickie's business partner believes that Stephanie holds the 'key' to the 40 million dollars missing from the law firm. Stephanie meets some interesting characters, from a taxidermist who is living at home waiting for the cable company with a penchant for bombs to a grave-robber who also does taxes in the back of his truck."
