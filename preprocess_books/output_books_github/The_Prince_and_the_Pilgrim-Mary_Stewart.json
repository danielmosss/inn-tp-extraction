    "text": " Prince Alexander is diverted in his quest for justice by the enchantments of Morgan LeFay, the seductive but evil sorceress. She persuades him to attempt a theft of the Holy Grail so that she can own it and thus gain power over King Arthur and his court. Alexander's search for the mysterious cup leads him to Alice. Together the prince and the pilgrim find what they've really been seeking: love. The tale is a self-contained novel taking place during Arthur's reign (possibly during the events in The Last Enchantment ), and does not serve as a follow-up to The Wicked Day."
