    "text": " The Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories follow the lives of two larcenous but likable rogues as they adventure across the fantasy world of Nehwon. The pieces in Swords and Deviltry introduce the duo and their relationship (\"Induction\"), present incidents from their early lives in which they meet their first lady-loves (Fafhrd in \"The Snow Women\", the Gray Mouser in \"The Unholy Grail\"), and relate how afterwards in the city of Lankhmar the two met and allied themselves with each other, and lost their first loves through their defiance of the local Thieves' Guild (\"Ill Met in Lankhmar\")."
