    "text": " It's Prom time at Beverly Hills High! Ben Birnbaum is back from Princeton University for the summer but also visiting is a friend of his family's. Maddy, a girl who's a junior in high school who has just had Gastric bypass surgery is staying with the Birnbaum's, and to Anna Percy's disdain, has quite the (newly) curvy figure. Adam discovers a shocking secret about Cammie's mom, one that will shake both her and her friend, Sam. Prom this year is being given by two B-List wannabes, Jasmine-Jazz and Ophelia-Fee. Sam tries to enter a film contest anonymously, and her subject for her documentary is the girls. She ends up helping much more than she intended, including securing the \"Collusseum\" where her father is shooting a remake of Ben Hur. Parker agrees to go with Sam to the Prom, in place of her sexy boyfriend Eduardo who can't make it because of a family engagement. They end up making out and unfortunately for Samantha she doesn't realize Eduardo's watching after he has come to show how much he cares for her and appreciates all Sam did for Prom. Anna explains to Ben that he should get off his horse and that she doesn't need saving. He says he loves her because she doesn't need saving. Between most of the couples in the A-List, on prom night, they are the only two that end the night without any problems."
