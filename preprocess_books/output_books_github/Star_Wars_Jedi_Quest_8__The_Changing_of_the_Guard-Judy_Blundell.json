Thanks to the laws of Romin, the Jedi cannot arrest Arbor and take her away. Arbor must leave the planet of her own free will. The Jedi hope to trick her into leaving by offering her a part in a heist, but it soon becomes apparent that she has other plans. Matters are complicated further when a civil war erupts on the planet and the Jedi are thrown into the middle of it. Will our heroes finally capture the evil scientist or will she slip away yet again?"
