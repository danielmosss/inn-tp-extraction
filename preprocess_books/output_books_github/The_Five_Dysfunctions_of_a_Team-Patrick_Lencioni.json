    "text": " According to the book, the five dysfunctions are: * Absence of trust—unwilling to be vulnerable within the group * Fear of conflict—seeking artificial harmony over constructive passionate debate * Lack of commitment—feigning buy-in for group decisions creates ambiguity throughout the organization * Avoidance of accountability—ducking the responsibility to call peers on counterproductive behaviour which sets low standards * Inattention to results—focusing on personal success, status and ego before team success"
