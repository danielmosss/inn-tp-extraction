    "text": " The setting for the novel is Seattle, at a company called Zephyr Holdings, although from the building it is difficult to discern the company's type of business. Apparently a defining characteristic of the company is its obscurity. In fact, in the novel no one has ever met the CEO. When Stephen Jones, a young recruit, reports for his first day in the Training Sales Department shortly after there has been a theft. Stephen is promoted from assistant to acting sales representative. However, Stephen believes the company is hiding somethingâ€”something that would explain why people who are fired seem to disappear. And, he wonders, what exactly is the Omega Management System?"
