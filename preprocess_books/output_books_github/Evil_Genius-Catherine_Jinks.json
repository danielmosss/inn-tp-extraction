    "text": " The story begins when a young Cadel Piggot is taken to a psychologist due to the fact that he is \"different\" from regular kids. Meaning he is more knowledgeable than other kids and is brilliant with computers. Because Cadel is a genius, his morality has significant consequences for those around him, and ultimately his use of his intellect destroys his surroundings until, at the last minute, he is saved by a moral code instilled in him by his relationship with a girl named Sonja Pirvert, who has cerebral palsy, although he does not know this or her name at first. His quest for moral direction is complicated by Phineas Darkkon, an evil genius of sorts whom he is told is his father, and Thaddeus Roth, his psychologist whom the police identify as Prosper English, a notorious criminal and right hand man of Dr. Darkkon, and who later also claims to be Cadel's father. He also meets a number of other talented people at the Axis Institute, which is the university Thaddeus and Phineas created for him to hone his criminal skills. His specialty is IT and hacking."
