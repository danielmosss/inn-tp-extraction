    "text": " The narrator and protagonist of the story is Clover, a young African-American girl. She lives beside a fence which segregates her town. Her mother instructs her never to climb over to the other side. Then one summer, she notices a white girl on the other side of the fence. The girl seems to be very lonely and is even outside when it's raining. Clover decides to talk to the girl on the other side of the fence. Both girls aren't allowed to cross the fence, so they simply decide to sit on the fence together. First, Clover's friends won't let Annie, the girl from the other side, play with them but then all of the girls realize that the fence (a symbol for segregation) should not be there."
