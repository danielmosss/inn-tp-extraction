    "text": " The book examines the background, founders and followers of a number of contemporary belief systems. Much of the book discusses the history of Scientology, including the early period and development of Dianetics. The book also describes the E-meter, various front groups, operating thetan, and the lifestyles of members whilst living at Scientology's then headquarters at Saint Hill Manor. Evans also reviews UFO cults, the Aetherians, the Atlanteans, biofeedback, yoga, theosophy, and The Fourth Way. He identifies a common theme of incorporating technological advances within a theological framework and contends that the allure of such cults is that they offer a sense of community and comfort in the face of a world dominated by science."
