    "text": " St. James explains how she met Hefner twice in the same week – on a Wednesday at the Hollywood club Las Palmas and then Friday at another club called Barfly. After approaching him at Barfly, she was invited to meet him at Barfly the following day. After attending various parties, she was invited to live at the mansion. The real substance of the book is in the depiction of what life was truly like at the Playboy Mansion. The author confirms that the girlfriends were recipients of free surgery, clothes, cars, and a weekly allowance. Behind the scenes, the author goes to great lengths to explain that Hugh Hefner had many strict rules including curfews, schedules, and routines. While living with Hefner’s other girlfriends, the author explains the struggles to capture Hefner’s attention while catfights and other internal tensions were highly common."
