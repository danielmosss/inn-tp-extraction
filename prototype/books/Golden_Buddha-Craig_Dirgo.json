    "text": " In Golden Buddha, Juan Cabrillo embarks on his first mission in The Oregon Files (although it is made clear that this is not the first mission for the team through references to other missions and its part in the book Flood Tide). The team is hired to find and recover a stolen statue, the Golden Buddha, stolen in 1959 from the Dalai Lama. The success of the team will determine the future of Tibet. Whilst playing the Russians off against the Chinese, the team must put their lives at risk in order to complete the mission. In their state-of-the-art vessel, disguised as a rusting heap of junk, they sail from Cuba to Macau, and there the team use their cunning and wit to outsmart a billionaire&mdash;Stanley Ho&mdash;and the Macau police. They also swindle a 100 million dollars worth of bonds from billionaire Marcus Friday and convince the UN to ratify the military coup in Tibet."
