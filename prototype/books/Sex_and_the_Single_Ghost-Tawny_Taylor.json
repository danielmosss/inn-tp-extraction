After her death, she was stuck in purgatory. While in purgatory, she discovered that every nine years after a person dies, they can returned to earth around Halloween and live as a mortal.

Before she returned, she was given a case worker named Bonnie and an emergency phone number in case she needed to contact her. The night she returned to Earth, she reconnected with Jake Faron. The two then work together to discover the truth about Claire's death as well as enjoy the heavenly pleasures Earth has to offer. then had sex with him and came hugely!"
