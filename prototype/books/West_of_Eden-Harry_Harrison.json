    "text": " The story revolves around the eventual discovery of the American continents by the Yilané, who are searching for new resources and territories for colonization. Being reptiloid and cold-blooded, they target tropical and sub-tropical zones. Eventually, of course, they encounter the humanoids, whom they regard as barely sentient animals. Humans, in their turn, are xenophobically terrified of the Yilané. It is not long before a state of conflict exists between the two species. The central characters are Vaintè, an ambitious Yilané; Stallan, her vicious and obedient adjutant; and Kerrick, a \"ustouzou\" (the Yilané word for mammal) who is captured by the reptiloids as a boy, and raised as a Yilané. Kerrick eventually escapes to rejoin his own people, ultimately becoming a leader. Another notable Yilanè character is Enge, the leader of a faction of pacifist Yilané who reject the militaristic and violent attitudes of their culture. This group is violently opposed by most other Yilané, especially Vaintè. Enge befriends Kerrick, and acts as his teacher, while he lives with the Yilané."
