    "text": " Lorian Nod is a promising Padawan and the best friend of Count Dooku. When Lorian decides to learn the ways of the Sith, Dooku must decide to side with the Jedi Council or his best friend. Thirteen years later, Dooku has become a Jedi Master and taken Qui-Gon Jinn as his Padawan. Lorian has been exiled from the Jedi Order and become a roaming space-pirate. In a twist of fate, Dooku will once more face his old friend. Thirty-two years later, Qui-Gon has lost his former apprentice Xanatos to the dark side and has after much thought decided to train Obi-Wan Kenobi. On one of their many missions, they must work together to fight Lorian Nod once again. Twenty-three years later, the Clone Wars have engulfed the galaxy. Obi-Wan and his own apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, have received a message from Lorian Nod calling for a treaty between himself and the Republic. Obi-Wan and Anakin journey to the planet, even if it is a trap. But the final showdown will be between two former Jedi, Count Dooku and Lorian Nod."
