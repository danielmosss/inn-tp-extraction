    "text": " Zack Freeman's bum is constantly detaching itself from his body and running off. One night, when he follows his bum, he learns that there is a plot by bums to take over the world. Specifically, the bums plan to create a huge, worldwide fart by building up a massive quantity of methane gas in the \"Bumcano\". When the Bumcano blows, all humans will be rendered unconscious. While they are unconscious, the bums will seize their chance and switch places with their heads. Fortunately, Zack meets the \"Bum-hunter\" Silas Sterne and his daughter, Eleanor, and is introduced to the realities of life in a world where bums are constantly a threat. To prevent the Bumcano eruption, the friends enlist the help of the Kisser, the Kicker, the Smacker and Ned Smelly. The characters encounter a variety of bum-related places and things, including the \"Great Windy Desert\", \"flying bum squadrons\", Stenchgantor The Great Unwiped Bum and the Great White Bum. Naturally, every possible opportunity for toilet humour is milked in this book for children, which won a number of Children's Choice awards in Australia. It is followed by Zombie Bums from Uranus (2003) and Bumageddon: The Final Pongflict (2005)."
