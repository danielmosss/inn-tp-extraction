    "text": " 1945 depicts what could have happened if Japan's surrender in World War II had been successfully hijacked by extremists, forcing U.S. President Harry S. Truman to order more atomic bombings and an invasion of the Japanese home islands, continuing the war into early 1946. Featured throughout the book includes the viewpoints of infighting among the Japanese officers responsible for the military coup of the Japanese government, the imprisonment and breakout of Hirohito, the vicious combat between Japanese and American soldiers on Kyushu and between the respective navies in the Pacific, the efforts behind enemy lines by intelligence officers and POWs, the death of Douglas MacArthur, the Soviet Union's involvement in the war, and the mass protesting in the US to end the war."
