She supports her unemployed brother, Bobby and his geek friend Erik in a small apartment in town. Just when it seems that she has a shot to get out of town, and start a career in modeling, the end of the world happens. Vivian and a rag-tag band of survivors must survive attacks from mutant creatures to make it to a distant sanctuary, that may or may not exist."
