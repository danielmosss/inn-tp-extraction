    "text": " Defeated and demoralised by treachery within the bandit tribes that he led, Imaro searches for vengeance, and for his kidnapped lover Tanisha. In the City of Madness, he finds both, along with a new ally, Pomphis, who seems to possess information about the dark forces that have houinded Imaro all his life. Pomphis doesnâ€™t have all the answers, but he suggests they might be found in the legendary city of Cush. As they embark on their quest for Cush, the forces arrayed against Imaro grow bolder, manifesting themselves as assassins, monsters and deadly creatures from the sea, all in a desperate attempt to prevent Imaro from reaching Cush. As the forces grow deadlier, the true nature of the coming continent-wide conflict becomes increasingly more apparent."
