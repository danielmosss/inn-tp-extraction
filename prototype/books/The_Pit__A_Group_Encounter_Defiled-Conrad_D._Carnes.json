    "text": " Events depicted in the book took place over four-days at the Hyatt House motel in Palo Alto, California, and included management executives from Holiday Magic. The book revealed details of the events that went on during the coursework at Mind Dynamics and Leadership Dynamics. The book stated that Holiday Magic participants in the Leadership Dynamics sessions were required to register in the coursework, at a cost of USD$1,000, \"..in order to get ahead in the company.\" Golembiewski stated that the book described \"illustrative chapter and verse\" of the coursework, including such training aids as a cross, a coffin, oxygen bottles, and piano wire. Participants that instructors deemed as \"dead\" to their lives, were told to stay in the coffin until they realized \"..how much it means to be alive.\""
