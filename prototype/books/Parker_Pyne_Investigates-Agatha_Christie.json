    "text": " James Parker Pyne is a retired government employee who considers himself to be a \"detective of the heart.\" Advertising his services in the \"Personal\" column of The Times, he works alongside his secretary Miss Lemon, novelist Ariadne Oliver, handsome \"lounge lizard\" Claude Luttrell and disguise artist Madeleine de Sara. The first six stories deal with Pyne solving cases in England, while the second six stories detail Pyne's vacation, where he hopes not to have to detective work only to end up helping others anyway."
