    "text": " As the novel begins, twelve-year-old Natalie Nelson is almost done writing a novel called The Cheater. It is uncommon for someone her age to get published, but Natalie's best friend, Zoe Reisman, thinks The Cheater is good enough. Natalie wants her mother, who works as an editor at Shipley Junior Books, to edit her manuscript, but she doesn't want her mother to find out that she wrote it. To accomplish this, Natalie uses the pseudonym Cassandra Day, and Zoe acts as her literary agent, fabricating the \"Sherry Clutch Literary Agency\" and renting a cheap office. The girls realize that they could use some adult help, and enlist Ms. Clayton, a teacher at their school. Later, when they are offered a publishing contract, they show it to Zoe's father, who is a lawyer. At the end of the story, Natalie's mom and Zoe arrange a publication party for The Cheater. At the party, Natalie finally tells her mom that she is Cassandra Day. It is hinted that Natalie will write more."
