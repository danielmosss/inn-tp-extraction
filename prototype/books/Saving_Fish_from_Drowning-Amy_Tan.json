From then on, the story is told through the omniscient first person narrative of Bibi Chen, the tour leader who unexpectedly dies before the trip takes place and who continues to watch over her friends as they journey towards their fate. The novel explores the relationships, insecurities and hidden strengths of the tourists, set against the uneasy political situation in Burma."
