    "text": " Outside Paris a wealthy American man named Longmore is introduced to his countrywoman Euphemia de Mauves. She is the sweet but austere wife of Comte Richard de Mauves, a cynical, womanizing Frenchman who hints that Longmore should take an amorous interest in his wife. Longmore resists the suggestion, even though he spots Richard with his latest mistress in a Paris cafe. Longmore still can't bring himself to become involved in an affair with Euphemia. He goes on a trip in the French countryside, where the sight of an artist and his girlfriend on a holiday, as well as a disturbing dream about Euphemia, makes him wonder if his scruples aren't foolish. Longmore finally leaves for America. Two years later he hears that Richard has committed suicide because Euphemia wouldn't forgive his adulteries and reconcile with him, though Richard promised to be faithful to her in the future. Although Euphemia is now free, Longmore is undecided about returning to Europe to pursue her."
