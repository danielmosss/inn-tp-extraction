    "text": " The book begins at the point at which High Five ended, revealing who Stephanie picked: Ranger or Joe Morelli. The story then jumps ahead five months, with Stephanie's friend Carol attempting to avoid jail-time by jumping off a bridge. Stephanie talks her down, and persuades the man who reported her not to press charges. In return, Stephanie must watch the man's dog, Bob, which she does. He never comes to take the dog back. Meanwhile, Stephanie must chase down Ranger, while being followed by two hit men (and getting four cars destroyed in the process). Stephanie's eccentric Grandma Mazur has moved in, as well, and to top it all off, Plum has to deal with a stoner named Mooner. In the end, it all works out. Stephanie even gains a proposal out of the deal."
