    "text": " In this novel, Li Kao and Number Ten Ox are attending the execution of a notorious criminal (about whose capture the less said the better, according to the chronicler) when into the public square bounds a \"vampire ghoul\" who soon meets a fiery demise. Master Li is given the case by the \"Celestial Master\" who soon becomes a main suspect. The plot involves everything from a conspiracy involving fake tea to dog-brides, puppeteers to magic birdcages, assorted pre-Chinese demons and gods, and the hooded and ancient Eight Skilled Gentlemen. The plot also involves a subject rarely mentioned in fiction, the pre-Chinese aborigines and their gods."
