    "text": " Women focuses on the many dissatisfactions Chinaski faced with each new woman he encountered. One of the women featured in the book is a character named Lydia Vance; she is based on Bukowski's one-time girlfriend, the sculptress and sometime poet Linda King. Another central female character in the book is named \"Tanya\" who is described as a 'tiny girl-child' and Chinaski's pen-pal. They have a weekend tryst. The real-life counterpart to this character wrote a self-published chapbook about the affair entitled \"Blowing My Hero\" under the pseudonym Amber O'Neil. In the book, Chinaski's nickname is Hank, which was one of Bukowski's nicknames."
