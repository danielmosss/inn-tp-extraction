They meet a young Charles Darwin and Mister Bobo, a highly trained and sophisticated \"man-panzee\", who have been exiled from London by a rival scientist. Having sunk the Beagle, which he believed was a Bank of England treasure ship thanks to a tip-off from Black Bellamy, the Pirate Captain agrees to take Darwin home and help him defeat his enemies."
