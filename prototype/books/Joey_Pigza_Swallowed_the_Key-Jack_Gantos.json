    "text": " The story, told from Joey's perspective, deals with his inability to control his impulses, due to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These impulses lead Joey to do numerous things, both at home and at school, which get him in trouble. Joey has been thinking about changing the world, after sneaking into an assembly. When his teacher comes back, at recess, he decides to make 1,000,000 bumper stickers. The scissors he uses are too small, and it hurts his hand, so he sneaks into his teacher's desk and takes the sharper, bigger scissors. He trips over his bunny slippers and cuts the tip off a girl's nose. Blood drips everywhere and she is put in an ambulance and rushed to the hospital. He gets put into the Special Ed Center downtown where he gets a transdermal patch and his behavior improves. He gets a dog later in the story who is just as hyper as he is, and is what he calls a \"Joey Pigza dog\", or a Chihuahua."
