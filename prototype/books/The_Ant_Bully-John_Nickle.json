The ants make a potion with special crystals in their hill and pour it in his ear ,when he is sleeping, so that he will turn into the size of an ant. He is forced by the queen ant to spend time as an ant, and learn their hard ways of the hill. When he finally understands, after many trials and classes, he gets bigger by an antidote and never hurts the ants again. He makes friends with the followers of the cruel boy who bullies him, and they chase off the bully for good."
