    "text": " While the Alliance fleet mounts a major campaign against a deadly warlord, tyrant Ysanne Isard has taken control of Thyferra, intending to withhold its supply of medicinal bacta to destabilize and destroy the New Republic (especially in light of a deadly plague she released into their ranks before doing so). Undermanned and deprived of Alliance support, Rogue Squadron must oppose Isard's plans, defeat her Star Destroyer fleet, and free Thyferra from her rule in an all-or-nothing battle against a seemingly superior force."
