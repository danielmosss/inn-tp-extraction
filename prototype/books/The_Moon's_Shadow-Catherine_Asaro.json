    "text": " After ascending the Carnelian throne, 17-year-old Eubian Emperor Jaibriol III is busy accomplishing many different goals â€” beginning peace talks with Skolian Imperialate, escaping death during several assassination attempts and marrying his beautiful, tricky and dangerous finance minister Tarquine Iquar. Above all, he has to hide from his Aristo fellows, that he is in fact a Rhon psion, for if his secret is ever revealed, he would face the fate of an enslaved provider. This novel overlaps with Ascendant Sun which tells the events after Radiance War from the point of view of new Skolian Imperator Kelric Valdoria and Spherical Harmonic which tells the events after Radiance War from the point of view of Pharaoh Dyhianna Selei. The Radiant Seas tells the story of Jaibriol's childhood on the planet Prizma and the course of Radiance War."
