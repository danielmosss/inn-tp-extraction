Davy knew he loved his wife ... as well as he knew he was going to kill her. He didn't know just when it was going to happen -- but when a man is born to be a murderer, it's only a matter of time before he claims his birthright. Love turns out to be a matter of life and death -- and it's up to Ellery Queen to make the choice!\""
