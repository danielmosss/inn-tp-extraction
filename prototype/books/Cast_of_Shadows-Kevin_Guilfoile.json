    "text": " The book's plot is set in the near future at a time when cloning has been legalised in the United States of America. It is based around a Chicago-based cloning doctor, Davis Moore, whose daughter is brutally raped and killed. The doctor uses the DNA of the murderer to clone him. The resulting clone is a boy called Justin Finn, which Moore follows throughout his life, hoping that the boy will offer him a glimpse into the psyche of the killer and perhaps enable him to find the identity of his daughter's murderer."
