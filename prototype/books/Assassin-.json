    "text": " The book begins with the story of Arabella \"Bella\" Getchel, who was taken hostage by John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of former President Abraham Lincoln, during the assassination at Ford Theatre itself. Wilkes, in the book's second chapter, mentions that he likes to be called by his last name. The book continually switches between the two stories, as Bella builds a friendship with a character named Steven and Wilkes. The friendship between Wilkes and Bella was merely a trap so he could get her to look for him in the theatre, where he locks her in a closet so she cannot stop him from assassinating the President."
