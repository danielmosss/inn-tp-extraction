    "text": " The story follows the short-lived but glamorous musical career of \"The Band with Rocks In\", a group of musicians who become famous after their leader, Imp Y Celyn a.k.a. 'Buddy' (Buddy Holly: the name is Welsh for \"bud of the holly\"), becomes possessed by the essence of an addictive new music dubbed 'Music With Rocks In'. The band is \"discovered\" by Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, who becomes the Disc's first manager. He tries to cash in on the band by any means possible while keeping them ignorant. He also hires the troll Asphalt as a roadie to accompany the band on its tour. Meanwhile, Death, in one of his philosophical moods, takes a holiday in search of a way to forget his more troubling memories, especially the recent demise of his adopted daughter Ysabell and her husband Mort. In the meantime, his granddaughter Susan discovers the truth about her heritage when she is forced to stand in for her missing grandfather. Complications ensue when she falls in love with Buddy, and tries to save him from his \"live fast, die young\" destiny as the Discworld's first rock star. Buddy wants to do a free concert, and after Dibbler figures out how much money he can make by selling T-shirts, sausages-in-a-bun etc. to the audience, he agrees. A large number of bands, all of whom have formed in response to the original \"Band with Rocks In\", participate in the largest concert of all time. Afterwards the band flees from their crazed fans, pursued by the angry Musicians Guild, C.M.O.T. Dibbler, Susan and Death. The cart in which the band is riding falls into a gorge, killing all its passengers, but Death intervenes to save them, afterward destroying the guitar which was the source of the new music. Thus the band is freed from their self-destructive destiny, and the spirit of the Music With Rocks in is driven from the Disc."
