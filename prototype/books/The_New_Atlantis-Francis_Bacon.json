    "text": " The novel depicts a mythical island, Bensalem, which is discovered by the crew of a European ship after they are lost in the Pacific Ocean somewhere west of Peru. The minimal plot serves the gradual unfolding of the island, its customs, but most importantly, its state-sponsored scientific institution, Salomon's House, \"which house or college ... is the very eye of this kingdom.\" Many aspects of the society and history of the island are described, such as the Christian religion - which is reported to have been born there as a copy of the Bible and a letter from the Apostle Saint Bartholomew arrived there miraculously, a few years after the Ascension of Jesus; a cultural feast in honor of the family institution, called \"the Feast of the Family\"; a college of sages, the Salomon's House, \"the very eye of the kingdom\", to which order \"God of heaven and earth had vouchsafed the grace to know the works of Creation, and the secrets of them\", as well as \"to discern between divine miracles, works of nature, works of art, and impostures and illusions of all sorts\"; and a series of instruments, process and methods of scientific research that were employed in the island by the Salomon's House. The interlocutors include the governor of the House of Strangers, Joabin the Jew, and the Head of Salomon's House. The inhabitants of Bensalem are described as having a high moral character and honesty, no official accepting any payment from individuals, and the people being described as chaste and pious, as said by an inhabitant of the island: In the last third of the book, the Head of the Salomon's House takes one of the European visitors to show him all the scientific background of Salomon's House, where experiments are conducted in Baconian method in order to understand and conquer nature, and to apply the collected knowledge to the betterment of society. Namely: 1) the end of their foundation; 2) the preparations they have for their works; 3) the several employments and functions whereto their fellows are assigned; 4) and the ordinances and rites which they observe. He portrayed a vision of the future of human discovery and knowledge. The plan and organisation of his ideal college, \"Salomon's House\", envisioned the modern research university in both applied and pure science. The end of their foundation is thus described: \"The end of our foundation is the knowledge of causes, and secret motions of things; and the enlarging of the bounds of human empire, to the effecting of all things possible\". In the describing the several employments and functions to which the members of the Salomon's House are assigned, the Head of the college said: Even this short excerpt demonstrates that Bacon understood that science requires analysis and not just the accumulation of observations. Bacon also foresaw that the design of experiments could be improved. In describing the ordinances and rites observed by the scientists of Salomon's House, its Head said: And finally, after showing all the scientific background of Salomon's House, he gave the European visitor permission to publish it:"
