    "text": " A young psychic boy is taken aboard a starship at the request of the government. The boy is considered both a misfit and dangerous because he has the ability to read minds on earth. However, once aboard he travels into deep space where he comes into contact with a sentient starship. The mission of the crew is to somehow communicate with the alien craft and bring it back to earth. However, things don't go to plan when the young psychic makes contact and decides to take matters into his own hands. *1979, USA, Doubleday ISBN 0-385-12785-5, Pub date 1 April 1979, Hardback *1980, UK, Sidgwick & Jackson, ISBN 0-283-98602-6, Pub date 1980, Hardback *1980, UK, Readers Union/The Science Fiction Book Club [UK], Pub date 1980, Hardback *1982, USA, Ace Books, ISBN 0-441-81292-9, Pub date, Feb 1982, Paperback *1982, UK, Sidgwick & Jackson, ISBN 0-283-98813-4, Pub date 1980, Omnibus Hardback *1983 France, Les Enfants du Voyage, Opta (OPTA - Galaxie Bis #96), ISBN 2-7201-0182-6, Cover: J.
