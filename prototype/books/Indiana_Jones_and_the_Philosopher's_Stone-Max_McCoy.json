    "text": " The search for wealth and immortality has sent men mad. Now Indiana Jones is called to London to recover an ancient alchemist's manuscript that is supposed to contain the formula both for creating gold from lead and also granting eternal life. Certain that a missing British alchemist and an insane Renaissance scholar are involved in the theft; Indy, along with the alchemist's beautiful sister, travels to Rome, and straight into the hands of Mussolini's fascists. The scholar Sarducci (who appears mad) has stolen the Voynich Manuscript. However the manuscript is also a map, leading readers into the desert and the most ancient and magnificent crypt in the world, where Indiana Jones will either witness an astounding miracle of alchemy, or become the tomb's next inhabitant."
