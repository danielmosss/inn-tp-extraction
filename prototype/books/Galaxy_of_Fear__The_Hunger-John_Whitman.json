After losing their ship in an attack by a bounty hunter, they find themselves landing on a certain swamp planet, where they encounter a rather friendly but starving tribe of survivors. Boba Fett is after the group, and in various occasions has them in his grasp. Yoda also makes an appearance in this book, teaching the children a valuable lesson."
