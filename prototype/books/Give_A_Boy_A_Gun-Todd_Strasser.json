Their problems get worse and worse as their lives go by and both boys seem to get darker and darker. They take their problems to the limit and having stress in their lives makes everything much worse. So Brendan and Gary bring guns to their school dance and hold everyone hostage for a while. They open fire on some students injuring them badly. Then after a long while a few boys sneak around and tackle Brendan disarming him, while Gary had already committed suicide. Then Brendan is beaten into a coma by the football team. It is not said if he survives. The story is written as a series of interviews conducted by a narrator, later revealed to be Gary's stepsister."
