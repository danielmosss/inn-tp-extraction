An official of the Indian government saw to it that a trained peregrine falcon was delivered to the boys to use in their investigation. Throughout their mission the falcon intercepts many messages between the smugglers as the criminals use pigeons to fly messages from place to place. Finally, the boys rescue the Indian prince and catch the human smugglers along with creating a strong bind between India and the Hardys."
