    "text": " Following events in the first novel, in which Carpenter learned that it is possible to leave Hell, Carpenter wants to help others in the way his benefactor helped him. Carpenter meets and travels through all the circles of the Hell described by Dante. He is accompanied in his travels by Sylvia Plath (whom he rescues from the Wood of the Suicides by burning her tree, causing her physical body to reform itself), attempting to understand the purpose of Hell and free many of the damned. Carpenter discovers that, apparently because he returned to Hell of his own free will to help others, he now possesses powers and abilities such as his mentor, Benito, also displayed. In his travels, Carpenter meets many well-known individuals deceased as of 2009. In addition to Plath, some of the notables encountered by Carpenter include: * Lester del Rey * Anna Nicole Smith * Else Frenkel-Brunswik * George Lincoln Rockwell * Ted Hughes * Charles Francis Adams, Sr. * Albert Camus * Carl Sagan * Seung-Hui Cho * Kenneth Lay * Aimee Semple McPherson * Peter Lawford * J. Edgar Hoover * Melvin Belli * Reinhard Heydrich * Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell * Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet * Jesse M. Unruh * Leon Trotsky * Pontius Pilate * J. Robert Oppenheimer * Frank Harris In the end, and partly as the consequence of some unusual changes to Hell itself, Carpenter not so much escapes as that he is shown the door for being a troublemaker."
