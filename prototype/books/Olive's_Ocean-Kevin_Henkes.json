Every day she and Godbee will tell about their secret to each other. While there, Martha develops a crush on one of Manning boys living nearby. Her older brother, Vince, is friends with them. She begins to spend more time with Jimmy Manning. She tells Godbee about him and all she has to say is to be careful. Jimmy is interested in film making and shoots a video. He asks Martha to join the love scene in his video taking and Jimmy kissed Martha. Martha is outraged when she learns he only did it for his video and to win a bet with the other boys.

In an accompanying note, he tells her that he likes her. At home in Wisconsin, Martha goes to Olive's mother to give the ocean water to her, only to find that Olive's mother had moved to Washington or Oregeon. Martha writes 'Olive' with ocean water on the front step of Olive's house until the water runs out. Martha stays until the sun dries up the word 'Olive'. And Olive who had been in her mind a long time finally gets forgotten. And then Martha returns home where her loving family is. The book will be made into a motion picture starring Elle Fanning."
