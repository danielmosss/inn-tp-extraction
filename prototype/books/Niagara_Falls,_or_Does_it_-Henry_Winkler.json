    "text": " Hank starts a new year at his school and meets his new teacher who has her students write an essay about their summer vacations. Hank has a hard time with homework and with staying on task which makes writing an essay a difficult assignment. Meanwhile, his grandpa, Papa Pete, asks Hank and his friends Ashley Wong and Frankie Townsend to put on a magic show at his bowling league game. However, his teacher made a statement to Hank saying she can't wait to see his creative report, so he has to do his report and perform for Papa Pete. Hank decides to make a model of Niagara Falls, where he spent his vacation, rather than write about it but when he presents the project in class he accidentally floods the classroom. Hank is given two weeks of punishment at school and at home. His punishment includes not being able to participate in the magic show for Papa Pete's bowling league. Finally, after a lot of convincing, his parents allow him to do the magic show. It was a relief to all the people at the bowling lanes because class bully and overall idiot Nick McKelty was performing in Magik 3's (Hank, Frankie, and Ashley's magic group) place. The magic show happens, and McKelty gets laughed at and thrown off stage. In the end, things go well for Hank, as he also meets the new music teacher, Mr. Rock, during detention, and they instantly like each other. Mr. Rock helps Hank with his essay and talks to his parents about his learning disabilities, which no one knew Hank had.He lives in New York City."
