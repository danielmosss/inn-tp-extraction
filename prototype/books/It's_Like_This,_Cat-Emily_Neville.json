Dave lives with his father and his asthmatic mother and her attacks worsen when Dave and his father have their frequent arguments. Dave's refuge after a clash with his father is with Kate, an elderly neighbor whose apartment is filled with the stray cats she loves. Dave adopts one of the cats, names it \"Cat\" and takes it home. \"Cat\" brings both joy and adventure into Dave's life. Cat's presence brings Dave into contact with several new people, including a troubled college-aged boy named Tom and his first girlfriend , Mary. While documenting Tom's growing maturity, the book also provides glimpses of a few of New York's neighborhoods and attractions, from the Fulton Fish Market to the Bronx Zoo and Coney Island."
