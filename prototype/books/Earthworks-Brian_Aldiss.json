    "text": " The novel is set in a world of environmental catastrophe and extreme socio-economic inequality. Outside crowded cities controlled by a police state, a class of wealthy and powerful \"Farmers\" exploit a rural prison labor population and hunt down subversive \"Travellers\" who have broken free of social controls. The novel is considered influential as both \"Travellers\" and the idea of the Earthwork have become part of public life in Britain."
