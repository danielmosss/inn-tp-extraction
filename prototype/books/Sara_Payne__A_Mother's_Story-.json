    "text": " The autobiography covers the abduction and murder of her daughter Sarah on 1 July 2000, and the effects that it had on herself, her family and the community. The first chapter of the book tells the story of Payne's life from 1985 and the age of 16, when shortly after leaving school she met her future husband Michael, and up to the stage when she had given birth to four of her five children. The following two chapters tell of Sarah's disappearance and then of the news that her body had been found. Further into the story, Sara tells of her campaigning for the introduction of Sarah's Law - and of how Mike confessed to her that he had paid for a gun and was preparing to shoot suspect Roy Whiting if he managed to avoid conviction for Sarah's murder. Whiting was eventually brought to trial, found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2001. Later on, just over a year after Whiting's trial, Payne discovered that she was pregnant. At first she was apprehensive about having another baby, but eventually decided to go ahead with her pregnancy. But this happy news did little to relieve the dark clouds that had been hanging over the Payne family since Sarah's death, and she and Michael agreed to separate four months before their baby's birth, although they remained good friends and were hoping that they might one day be able to live together again. The final chapter of the book tells of Sara giving birth to her fifth child, Ellie. She tells the reader that Ellie's birth gave the family new hope and some much-awaited happiness after more than three years of misery."
