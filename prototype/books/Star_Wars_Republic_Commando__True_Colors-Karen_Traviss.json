    "text": " In the Grand Army's desperate fight to crush the Separatists, the secret special ops missions of its elite clone warriors have never been more critical...or more dangerous. A growing menace threatens Republic victory and the members of Omega Squad make a discovery that shakes their loyalty. As the lines continue to blur between friend and enemy, citizens—from civilians and sergeants, to Jedi and generals—find themselves up against a new foe: the doubt in their hearts and mind. The truth is a fragile, shifting illusion, and only the approaching inferno will reveal both sides in their true colors."
