Helping Stephanie is former-prostitute-turned-backup Lula, puzzle solving transvestite singer Sally Sweet, mentor Ranger, and vice cop Joe Morelli. This one won't be easy though, as Stephanie's competing with her arch nemesis Joyce Barnhardt. Oh, and she can't forget the little matter of someone trying to kill her. Again. Stephanie & Morelli resume their intimate relationship."
