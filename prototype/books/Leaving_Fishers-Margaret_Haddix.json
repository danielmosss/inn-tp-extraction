    "text": " Dorry Stevens, a lonely new transfer to Indianapolis, is befriended by a group of attractive and attentive young classmates who invite her to a number of church functions. Their warm welcome has quite an effect on her, and she is soon baptized into her new faith at a Fishers retreat. After returning from the retreat, she finds out that her mother has had a heart attack. Her family life becomes more difficult as bad grades pile up and the pressure from the Fishers to gain \"virtue\" points and abstain from sin increases. Eventually, after a particularly bad incident concerning children that she babysits, she takes the initiative to leave the oppressive cult and forms a group of her own of \"Seekers\", those hollowed from their experiences in Fishers. Her faith in God remains strong, and she considers herself to be searching for the truth."
