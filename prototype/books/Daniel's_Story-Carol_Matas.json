    "text": " Daniel barely remembers leading a normal life before the Nazis came to power in 1933. He can still picture once being happy and safe, but memories and days are fading away as he and his family face the dangers threatening Jews in Hitler's Germany the late 1930s. No longer able to practice their religion, vote, own property, or work, Daniel's family is forced from their home in Frankfurt. First, they are deported to the ghetto in Lodz,Poland, and then to Auschwitz (the Nazi extermination camp). He survives the torments of the concentration camp and is transported to Buchenwald. Daniel endures to witness the camp's liberation in 1945. Though many around him lose hope in the face of such terror, Daniel, supported by his courageous family, struggles for survival. Yet he manages to retain his life, hope and dignity through the horrors of Hitler's Final Solution."
