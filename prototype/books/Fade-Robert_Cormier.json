    "text": " In the summer of 1938, the young Paul Moreaux who lives in a town outside of Boston called Monument, discovers he can \"fade\". \"Fading\" is the term used for being invisible and becoming invisible to the world. His family has had this ability generation after generation. It is passed down from uncle to nephew. First bewildered, then thrilled with the possibilities of invisibility, Paul experiments with his \"gift\". This ability shows him things that he should not witness. His power soon overloads him, shows him shocking secrets, pushes him over the edge, and drives him toward some chilling and horrible acts from which there is no forgiveness, no forgetting, and no turning back. His depressing downfall impacts the reader. Paul discovers how cruel, evil, and disgusting the world can be. Paul sees so much by his gift. The ability to fade becomes a nightmare because he learns so much that he did not want to see or hear."
