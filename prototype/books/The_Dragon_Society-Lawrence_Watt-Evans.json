    "text": " After the events of the first book, Dragon Weather, Arlian finds himself armed with the knowledge of how dragons reproduce. It is a nasty and terrible business and Arlian wishes to prevent dragons from ever reproducing. Using the magic gathered in Arithei, he continues his quest. He realizes that if he is to fulfill his quest of destroying the dragons he must destroy the entire dragon society which is made up of dragon hearts. Dragon hearts are those who have drunk a mixture of human blood and dragon venom and gain a long extended life and a baby dragon growing in their heart. Arlian and his best friend Black hunt down the dragons in the hope that if Arlian kills a dragon the duke will assist him in destroying the dragon menace. In the end he removes a dragon from the heart of a Lady Rhime which wakes up its mother. The mother dragon comes to Manfort to kill Arlian but instead falls victim to an obsidian spear. This means Arlian is the first man to kill a dragon ever. He receives the full assistance of the duke and named warlord in the coming battle against the dragons. Even with the success of killing a dragon Arlian's task is far from over."
