    "text": " In the book, Collier describes her experiences with recreational drug use, including marijuana and LSD, and then her introduction to Eastern spirituality through life on an ashram. At age sixteen, Collier had become friends with Abbie Hoffman, then moved to live first on a commune and later a Divine Light Mission ashram. The book describes her initiation to the Techniques of Knowledge of Guru Maharaj ji (also known as Prem Rawat) and her experiences in the organization. Years later, in an interview published in 2001 in Fast Company magazine, Collier stated that \"At the ashram, we did things like staying up all night and meditating, things that taught us how to focus our minds\". Skills that she still applies in stressful business situations, and that \"drawing on those experiences has definitely helped me maintain perspective.\""
