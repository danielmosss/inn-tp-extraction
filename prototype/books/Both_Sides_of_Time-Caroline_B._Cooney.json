    "text": " Annie Lockwood, a young woman who is interested in the Victorian era, contemplates whether or not she is in the right relationship with her current boyfriend, Sean. When she enters the amazing Stratton Mansion she is wrenched from her time (approximately 1995) back 100 years into the past. In this past, she meets the inhabitants of the house, including a young man named Strat. Murders happen in the house, and Annie soon falls in love with Strat, and she ends up going back and forth between the two time periods, but it must be decided where and with whom she will ultimately remain."
