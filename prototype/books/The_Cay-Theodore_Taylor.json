    "text": " When World War II breaks out, Phillip Enright and his mother board the S.S. Hato to Virginia because the mother feels it's unsafe to stay in Cura√ßao. The ship is torpedoed, and Phillip is blinded by a blow on the head and is stranded on an island with Timothy, an old black man and a black cat. They build a hut, and keep track of the days by throwing pebbles in a can. They live alone together for two months. In the opening chapters of the book, the pair display significant difficulty in being able to tolerate and work with each other, partly because of young white Phillip's racial prejudice against the elderly black Timothy. The two characters learn to overcome their disdain for one another, and develop strong bonds of friendship by the end of the novel. Their relationship changes rapidly throughout the novel starting with complete hate and them showing signs of teamwork to a point where Phillip doesn't need Timothy anymore but Timothy needs Philip."
