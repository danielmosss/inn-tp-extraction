    "text": " Angus wants to be Bumface, a pirate character he has created. Bumface is brave, bold, wild and free. He stars in the stories Angus tells his younger brother and sister. Instead, Angus is just plain tired from having to change his sister Imogen's nappies and scrape food off the walls. He has to look after his siblings while his famous soap opera actress mother works and chases men. His father and stepfathers don't have time to look after their own children. Angus doesn't want to be mum's Mr Dependable or dad's Mr Reliable he just wants to be Angus. In the end, Angus gets his own back."
