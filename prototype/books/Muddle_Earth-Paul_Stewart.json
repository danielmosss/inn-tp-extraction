    "text": " Joe, a boy from ordinary Earth, has been summoned to Muddle Earth -a world full of monsters and mayhem and more- by the wizard Randalf. He is then exhorted as a 'warrior-hero'. In other words, he must fight evil on behalf of Randalf, who has in turn been contracted by the ruler of Muddle Earth, the Horned Baron. The Horned Baron, however, has problems that even Randalf cannot attend to: his wife Ingrid is a very demanding woman. This is a trait that the evil villain Doctor Cuddles pays heed to, and uses to his advantage in all three sections of the novel."
