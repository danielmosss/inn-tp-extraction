    "text": " Thirteen-year-old Theodore lives in a remote region of China at his father's Mission. When the violence of the Boxer Rebellion finally reaches them, Theodore escapes alone from its destruction. He soon becomes one companion of a formidable Englishwoman, \"painted, blasphemous, gun-toting Mrs Jones\". She is an amateur botanist and a former actress with an entourage. The party flees bandits into Tibet and take refuge at a Tibetan Buddhist monastery. Theodore is briefly seen to be the Tulku, a great lama reincarnated; then the recently conceived child of Mrs Jones and her Chinese lover is identified as the one. Theodore is exposed to the \"magnetic, repugnant rituals of Buddhism\" and develops as a \"whole, willing Christian\". Mrs Jones is recruited to remain on site and the boy finally returns to England with the fruit of her botanical expedition."
