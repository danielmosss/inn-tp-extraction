    "text": " This, though necessary, is not sufficient to account for the multifariousness of the work. The scheme of the allegorical satire not only overlaps with the narrative scheme of the romance or history, but with the epistolary novel as well, the parody of which is but the first external frame inside which many other genres are parodied. The story of the squabble is just half the work. The other half is a \"subjoined\" key to the allegory and two other letters. And \"subjoining\" a key, which is in the end no key at all, represents, literary speaking, a \"scandal\" as shameful as the topical misdeeds that are told. Inexorably, the focus of the scandal shifts from the allegorical history of facts to the allegorical romance of their reading."
