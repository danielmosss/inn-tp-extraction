    "text": " After the death of his wife Gail, Jeremy Bremen leaves his previous life by burning his home and possessions and embarking on a journey to find peace from the 'neurobabble' of humanity. Without his wife's presence Bremen cannot shield himself from the unwanted ability to read minds and hear thoughts. Bremen searches for solitude and isolation from people, which he initially finds, however as the novel progresses he is exposed to increasing levels of contact with humanity and horrifying experiences of malicious and violent behaviour. Transposed with Bremen's story is that of another character, 'Robby', who appears to be narrating and commenting upon Bremen and his wife's life. Robby is severely disabled and unable to communicate as he is deaf, mute and blind. How he is able to have such familiarity with Bremen is not disclosed until towards the end of the novel."
