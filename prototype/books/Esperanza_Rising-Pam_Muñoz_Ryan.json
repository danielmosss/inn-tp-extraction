The night before Esperanza's thirteenth birthday Esperanza's father is murdered by bandits. Esperanza, her mother, Grandmother Abuelita and their servants are devastated by the news.

After a long and tedious train ride the group arrives in Los Angeles and then travel by truck to the San Fernando Valley where they meet a girl named Isabel, her parents Juan and Josefina, and Isabel's baby brother and sister, Lupe and Pepe. Due to her privileged background, Esperanza is hated by some of the workers, and she finds it difficult to adapt to her new life.

After many months Mama eventually recovers and is released from the hospital to be with her friends and family.
