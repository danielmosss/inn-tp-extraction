    "text": " Pinker argues that language provides a window into human nature, and that \"analyzing language can reveal what people are thinking and feeling.\" He asserts that language must do two things: # convey a message to an audience, and # negotiate the social relationship between the speaker and the audience. Therefore, language functions at these two levels at all times. For example, a common-place statement such as \"If you could pass the salt, that would be great\" functions both as a request (though formally not a request) and as a means of being polite or non-offensive (through not directing the audience to overt demands). Pinker says of this example: Through this lens, Pinker asks questions such as \"What does the peculiar syntax of swearing tell us about ourselves?\" Or put another way, \"Just what does the 'fuck' in 'fuck you' actually mean?\", - as discussed in the chapter The Seven Words You Can't Say on Television. The arguments contained within ride on the backs of his previous works, which paint human nature as having \"distinct and universal properties, some of which are innate â€“ determined at birth by genes rather than shaped primarily by environment.\""
