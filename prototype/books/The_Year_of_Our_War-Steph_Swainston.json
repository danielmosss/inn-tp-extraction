    "text": " The novel is set in the Fourlands, a country in danger of being overrun by large hostile Insects, and follows the exploits of Jant, also called \"the Messenger\" or \"Comet\". As a half-breed of two humanoid species Jant is the only person who can fly, which makes him an indispensable part of the Emperor's Circle of about 50 immortals, an elite group of (mostly) warriors who do not age (but, despite the name, are capable of being killed). Swainston spins an intricate story which covers, among other things, the intrigues among mortals and immortals from the various humanoid races of the Fourlands, a full-scale assault by the Insects (previously held at bay behind an Insect wall), and Jant's exploits in the \"Shift\", an alternate world which he enters as a side effect of his addiction to a lethal drug. So far, two sequels, No Present Like Time (2005) and The Modern World (2007) have been published. A fourth book, Above the Snowline, was published in 2010."
