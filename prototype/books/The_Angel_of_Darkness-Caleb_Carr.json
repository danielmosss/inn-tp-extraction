    "text": " Stevie Taggert tells of the mystery of Se√±ora Linares's missing child. Set in 1897, the mystery is complicated by rising tensions between Cuba and the United States and forces the team to ask, within the context of their era, a complex ethical question, could the act of a woman murdering her own kids be looked at as her trying to gain control over her life and her world?"
