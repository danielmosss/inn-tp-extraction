    "text": " From the book (Paperback Edition): Near Washington, D.C., there are two clandestine institutions: a laboratory developing advanced technology, and a secret CIA training camp. Sean King, financially hard-pressed and trying to help his professional—and platonic—partner, does something he had decided to never do: look for a \"job\" from his ex-girlfriend Joan Dillinger, a fellow ex-Secret Service agent who has gone private running her own PI agency. She gives him a case at a lab. The murder of a scientist by the name of Monk Turing draws Sean King to the lab. While searching for answers, he soon stumbles on Camp Peary, the CIA training facility which leads him to a more complicated puzzle. While working on the case, he soon comes across Turing's autistic daughter, Viggie Turing, who is also an extraordinary genius. She helps Michelle only because she trusts Michelle. She hates Horatio, the psychologist who is there to help both Michelle and Viggie. He works together with his partner, Michelle Maxwell, who has attempted suicide after a psychological breakdown. In the end, Sean and Michelle are able to crack the case, but for that they had to undergo torture at the hands of their enemies. Sean's generosity is evident when instead of taking up the treasures money he gets it divided in three parts for three different people, though his financial condition wasn't very good."
