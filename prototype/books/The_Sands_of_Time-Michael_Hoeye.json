    "text": " Mild-mannered watchmaker Hermux Tantamoq is up to his ears in trouble again. All of Pinchester is talking about his friend Mirrin Stentrill's paintings, which are monumental portraits of cats! After all, cats are not a popular topic in a city of rodents â€” and everyone knows they never really existed. Then a mysterious old chipmunk appears in Hermux's shop with what he claims is a map of the royal library of a prehistoric kingdom of cats. Before long Hermux is hot on a trail of treachery and deceit, leading all the way from Pinchester to an ancient tomb that lies buried in... The Sands of Time!"
