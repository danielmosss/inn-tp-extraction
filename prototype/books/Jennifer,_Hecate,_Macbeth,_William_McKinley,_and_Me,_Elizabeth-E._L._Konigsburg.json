    "text": " Jennifer is narrated by the protagonist, Elizabeth in the title. She has moved into a big apartment building in a town where almost everyone lives in a house.Third Aladdin edition, p. 4. She doesn't yet have any friends when she meets Jennifer on her way back to school after lunch on Halloween day. Although dressed as a Pilgrim, Jennifer claims to be a real witch. After one Saturday meeting, Jennifer takes Elizabeth as an apprentice and sets weekly meetings with assignments. \"For the first week ... you must eat a raw egg every day. And you must bring me an egg every day. Make mine hard boiled.\"Third Aladdin edition, p. 32. They meet only in school, the library, the park, or the woods between home and school. The apprenticeship is difficult for Elizabeth. Sometimes she gets mad at Jennifer, but \"before I'd got Jennifer, I'd had no one.\"Third Aladdin edition, p. 40. After several weeks they choose a long project, to prepare an ointment that conveys the ability to fly. It will also be a test for Elizabeth's promotion from apprentice. The final ingredient will be a live toad, selected in advance. During the intervening months, the toad becomes a pet. Elizabeth stops Jennifer from adding him to the brew, which terminates the ointment and their friendship. Later she realizes that her affection for the toad was part of the test. Finally Elizabeth deduces that Jennifer's father is gardener at \"The Estate\" across the street, and they live on site. As Elizabeth proudly puts the clues together, Jennifer is walking to her door. Inside, Jennifer soon laughs and admits that she is not a real witch. The two girls become normal friends."
