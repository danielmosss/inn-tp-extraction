    "text": " Humanity is trapped in a \"gravity well\", the so-called Forbidden Borders. Two remaining human empires - the Regan Empire and the Divine Sassa - are poised to fight one last war for domination of Free Space. The Lord Commander, Staffa Kar Therma a.k.a. The Star Butcher, is a mercenary who leads an elite group of soldiers (the Companions). He has aligned himself to The Seddi Order, a former quasi-religious group in an effort to stop humanity from making itself extinct. The Regan Emperor has been assassinated, and Internal Security Minister Ily Takka has now taken control of the Regan Empire. She plots darkly, and has ordered little respected, but brilliant Division First (Commander) Sinklar Fist to return to Rega and become the leader of her military. The reader can expect shenanigans. She will attempt to rule all worlds under human control in Free Space ... but at what price?"
