    "text": " John of Lancaster is the son of Henry IV and the favourite brother of Henry V. This book chronicles his life from 1393 through until 1413. Although incomplete (the book is finished where Heyer left it) the Historical Note at the end fills in the gaps. Uses a lot of Middle English language but includes a Glossary for easier reading in the back. Simon the Coldheart (1925) covers much the same period (1400â€“1418). Kings Henry IV and Henry V also appear in it."
