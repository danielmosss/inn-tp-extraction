    "text": " Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science starts with a brief survey of the spread of the ideas of \"cranks\" and \"pseudo-scientists\", attacking the credulity of the popular press and the irresponsibility of publishing houses in helping to propagate these ideas. Cranks often cite historical cases where ideas were rejected which are now accepted as right. Gardner acknowledges that such cases occurred, and describes some of them, but says that times have changed: \"If anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting questionable theses to be published\". Gardner acknowledges that \"among older scientists ... one may occasionally meet with irrational prejudice against a new point of view\", but adds that \"a certain degree of dogma ... is both necessary and desirable\" because otherwise \"science would be reduced to shambles by having to examine every new-fangled notion that came along.\" Gardner says that cranks have two common characteristics. The first \"and most important\" is that they work in almost total isolation from the scientific community. Gardner defines the community as an efficient network of communication within scientific fields, together with a co-operative process of testing new theories. This process allows for apparently bizarre theories to be published - such as Einstein's theory of relativity, which initially met with considerable opposition; it was never dismissed as the work of a crackpot, and it soon met with almost universal acceptance. But the crank 'stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated. He does not send his findings to the recognized journals or, if he does, they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent'. The second characteristic of the crank (which also contributes to his or her isolation) is the tendency to paranoia. There are five ways in which this tendency is likely to be manifested. #The pseudo-scientist considers himself a genius. #He regards other researchers as stupid, dishonest or both. #He believes there is a campaign against his ideas, a campaign comparable to the persecution of Galileo or Pasteur. He may attribute his 'persecution' to a conspiracy by a scientific 'masonry' who are unwilling to admit anyone to their inner sanctum without appropriate initiation. #Instead of side-stepping the mainstream, the pseudo-scientist attacks it head-on: The most revered scientist is Einstein so Gardner writes that Einstein is the most likely establishment figure to be attacked. #He has a tendency to use complex jargon, often making up words and phrases. Gardner compares this to the way that schizophrenics talk in what psychiatrists call 'neologisms', \"words which have meaning to the patient, but sound like Jabberwocky to everyone else.\" These psychological traits are in varying degrees demonstrated throughout the remaining chapters of the book, in which Gardner examines particular \"fads\" he labels pseudo-scientific. His writing became the source book from which many later studies of pseudo-science were taken (e.g. Encyclopedia of Pseudo-science)."
