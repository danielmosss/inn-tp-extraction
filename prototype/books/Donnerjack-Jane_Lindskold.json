    "text": " The book combines gods with high technology. Computers have gone independent in a Virtual Reality that contains many elements borrowed from myth and legend. Death features as a major character, and the hero must rescue his lady-love from him. Other actual and virtual myth-figures come into it. It is not connected with Jack of Shadows"
