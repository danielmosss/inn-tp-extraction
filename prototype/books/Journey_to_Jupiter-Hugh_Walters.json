    "text": " The first manned expedition to Jupiter reaches speeds never experienced before; despite this it takes several months to reach its objective, leading to tensions among the crew, as well as serious vision problems caused by \"light slip\" A miscalculation in the gravity of Jupiter means that they will not be able to stop in time and will crash into the giant planet.
