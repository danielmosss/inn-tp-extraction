    "text": " A murderer who carves a K into his victims is imprisoned in Jabba's palace, when the story begins. A prisoner tricks Zak into believing that he is innocent, and Zak lets him escape. This is presumed to be the same murderer. Later, Zak thinks he sees Tash kill someone and carve the same K. This is explained when a brain spider spells out \"IM TASH\" in sand, suggesting that the murderer's brain was placed in Tash's body and that Tash's brain was placed in a spider. Tash tries to develop her sense of the force at the Sarlacc pit."
