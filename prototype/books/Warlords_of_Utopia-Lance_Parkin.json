    "text": " The glorious Roman Empire has ruled for nearly twenty-seven centuries when Marcus Americanius Scriptor acquires a strange bracelet from a mysterious stranger. With this bracelet, he finds he is able to travel to alternate Romes, worlds where the course of history has diverged from that with which he is familiar. And further out, worlds where there is no Roman Empire at all, and a cruel new regime in Germania is on a path of conquest. This cannot be permitted."
