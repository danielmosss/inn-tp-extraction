    "text": " Everything is a confusion in the New Apsolon mission. The Jedi Knight Tahl, partner of Qui-Gon Jinn, has been trapped. The Jedi Master soon forgets his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi and goes after his beloved Tahl. No one can be trusted and Tahl is dying. When Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon discover Tahl, she is severely maimed. After returning to the capital, Tahl perishes, which sends Qui-Gon over the edge. Qui-Gon now begins his call to vengeance, which is targeted at the leader of the rogue faction that caused the entire catastrophe."
