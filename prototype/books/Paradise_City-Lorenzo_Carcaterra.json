Giancarlo grows up to become an educated yet street-wise cop within the poverty and crime-ridden southern Italian city. His on-going battle with the city's organized crime families has him in constant contact with his native NYC. Then one day, his young niece, who is on an exchange trip to the city that never sleeps, goes missing resulting in Giancarlo canceling his holiday to the Capri in exchange for the Island of Manhattan to search for her."
