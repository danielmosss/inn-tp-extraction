    "text": " The novel retells the story of Hamlet from Ophelia's point of view. When Ophelia is taken to Elsinore Castle to rejoin her unknown father, she becomes torn between her love for Prince Hamlet and for the pirate Ragnor. She cannot understand why she is the only one who can see the many ghosts who haunt the castle, and soon finds herself involved in a plot to kill the queen and take her place. Eventually, it seems that only madness is the way to save those she loves in the dangerous world of the Danish royal court."
