Coriander's dad is arrested and is left with her step mother and step sister. The step mother has sacked Coriander's favorite servant as well as friend. After hiding a doll in the cupboard Coriander's step mother is mad.Coriander cannot wait until her dad's return. But is he going to?

As all things she once knew vanish, she must fight the horrors of the angry, puritan world in which she lives, and those of the world of magic, which holds the secret of time and all things possible. But as a death draws nearer, there is another question to answer. Whose is it?"
