    "text": " The lower-case letters climb up a coconut tree in alphabetical order, until the tree bends so much that the letters fall to the ground. Capital letters (the older relatives of the letters climbing the tree) come to help them. Again alphabetically, it describes each letter's injury, including: *\"D\" having skinned-knee *\"E\" having a stubbed toe *\"F\" becoming patched up *\"H\" and \"I\" getting tangled together *\"L\" being knotted like a tie *\"M\" being looped *\"N\" being stooped *\"O\" being twisted; alley-oop *\"P\" having a black eye *\"T\" having a loose tooth The book is notable for its rhyming structure which is reminiscent of the jazz vocal improvisation technique known as scat singing. An audio book version is also available. It inspired a 2004 sequel, Chicka, Chicka, 1, 2, 3. A board book for toddlers, entitled Chicka, Chicka ABC was published in 1990 and contains the first half of the full story."
