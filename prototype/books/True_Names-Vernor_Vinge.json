    "text": " The story follows the progress of a group of disaffected computer wizards (called \"warlocks\" in the story) who are early adopters of a new full-immersion virtual reality technology, called the \"Other Plane\". Forming a cabal, they must keep their true identities – their True Names – secret even to each other and to avoid prosecution by their \"Great Adversary\" – the government of the United States. The protagonist is one of these warlocks. Known as \"Mr. Slippery\" in the Other Plane; his True Name is Roger Pollack. When a new warlock arrives in the Other Plane and begins to recruit other warlocks for a scheme in which the domination of cyberspace can be used to exert power in the real world, Mr. Slippery is forced to ally himself with the Great Adversary."
