    "text": " Ancient Eastern languages professor Jonathan Jones (Tom Poston) finds a magic amulet. Via the amulet, Jones obtains powers to cause pain or slow movement, and even kill. He immediately suffers the consequences of his discovery: Jones realizes that when he points at another living creature, it causes a great pain (this is a metaphor of the age of nuclear weapons, as the novel was written two years after atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). In the movie, Jones tries to warn the Department of Defense and get rid of the amulet, but is taken for a madman. Then the Soviet Union gets interested and the adventures begin. The film begins with the Columbia Pictures logo talking to William Castle and ends with the logo saying, \"Zotz all,\" a play on the words \"That's all.\""
