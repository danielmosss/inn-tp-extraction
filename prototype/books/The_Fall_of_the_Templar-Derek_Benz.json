All hope seems lost until the Templar Knights discover clues that may lead them to a relic with the power to stand against the Spear. Now Max Sumner, Natalia Romanov, Harley Eisenstein, and Ernie Tweeny must join the Templar in a treacherous journey into the Underworld as they hunt for that lost relic and try and save the planet from extinction. But even if they make it through the underground labyrinth, an ageless dragon awaits at the end of their quest."
