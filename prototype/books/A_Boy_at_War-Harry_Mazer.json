    "text": " In the beginning, Adam has to move to Honolulu because his father is relocated to Pearl Harbor as a military officer. It is really hard just like any kid moving and having to go to a different high school, but it is especially hard for Adam because in the book it mentions how people at Honolulu High School hate military kids. The book never really explained why. But Adam did manage to make two friends. Their names are Davi Mori and Martin Kahahawai. Davi is a Japanese American, while Martin is a Hawaiian. One day the boys decide to go fishing early in the morning. As they are fishing on the land at Pearl Harbor, they find a rowboat and decide to take it out into the water. As they are fishing, they hear airplanes flying overhead. Davi cheers because he thinks these are American planes, but Adam realizes that they are Japanese planes and thinks that Davi is a spy signaling the airplanes. They then see the Japanese bomber planes bomb the naval ships at Pearl Harbor. When the first bombs are dropped, part of their rowboat explodes, and a piece of wood flies into Martin’s chest. He is wounded, but doesn’t die. Adam watches as his father's ship, the Arizona, goes down. Once the Japanese leave the harbor in the morning, Adam runs home with a rifle and makes sure his Mom and sister, Bea, are okay. They let Adam in the house, and he tells them what happened and that he doesn’t know if his Dad, Lt. Emory Pelko, is dead or alive. About a week after Adam arrives back home, the family gets a telegram saying the Lt. Emory Pelko is missing. So the family then moves back to the mainland of America."
