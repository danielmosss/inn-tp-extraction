    "text": " The novel concerns a doctor who develops a mechanical method of eradicating painful memories from people's brains so that they can feel good about life again. The protagonist persuades his lover to try the process after she has been seduced by a rival. She is transformed until the protagonist awakes and realizes that he has dreamt of the doctor and his process and that his lover has committed suicide. The book is notable for its vivid description of small-town American life and mores in the period (1880). The 'Process' mentioned in the title is a plot mechanism to introduce a long discussion of the meaning of guilt. If one loses ones memory of the deed, is one still guilty? If one has changed of time since the deed, is one still guilty? The argument also emphasises the difference between guilt (in the eyes of others) and remorse (one's own judgement), and suggests that forgiveness can remove guilt but not remorse. (Information in this paragraph based on my recent reading of the book)."
