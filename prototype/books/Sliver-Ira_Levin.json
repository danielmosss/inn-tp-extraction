    "text": " When working woman Kay Norris makes the acquaintance of a handsome and friendly young man who lives in the same \"sliver\" building, she does not know at first that he is the owner. While keeping a low profile himself, he turns out to know an awful lot about the other inhabitants including many of their secrets. It then turns out that he is a modern-day Peeping Tom who, unknown to everyone, has had surveillance cameras and microphones installed in every single apartment of the house, with his own place in the building serving as his headquarters. The novel is also a murder mystery, and the beautiful heroine soon becomes a damsel in distress herself. de:Sliver (Film) es:Sliver (película) fr:Sliver ja:硝子の塔 pl:Sliver ru:Щепка (фильм) sv:Sliver"
