    "text": " The novel concerns an interplanetary narcotics agent who is forced to work on an incredibly cold world (from his point of view â€” the planet is in fact Earth), where he teams up with natives of the alien planet (humans) in his attempt to stop the smuggling of a dangerous drug (tobacco) to Sirius. Although the story involves both aliens and humans, it is told primarily from an alien perspective."
