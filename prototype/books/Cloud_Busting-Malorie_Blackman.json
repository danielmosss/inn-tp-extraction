    "text": " The story begins when Mr Mackie, the teacher, assigns the homework to the class – to write a poem. Sam wants to write his poem about Davey. Alex, his ex-best friend, mocks him for doing so. Sam quotes: \"I want to write my poem about Davey Because now he's gone And I can't get him out of my head.\" Davey, or 'Fizzy Feet', is a new boy. Everyone (except Alicia) hates him. He has holes in his jumper, and strange ideas fill his mind. Sam, the school bully, makes fun of him. He dislikes Davey as much, if not more, than everyone else. That is, until Davey saves his life, pulling him from in front of a speeding vehicle. The two soon become friends. Davey's way of looking at life begins to seem fun. Sam learns that Davey has an allergy to peanuts, and Davey tells him to keep it a secret as he didn't want a fuss. But, in front of his ex-best friend, the bully, Alex, he accidentally lets it slip – big mistake. Alex, as a joke, offers Davey a part of his sandwich, with a peanut slipped inside. Davey immediately has an allergic reaction, and Mr Mackie is forced to use the epipen. Davey regains consciousness and is whisked to hospital. Davey begins to avoid Sam, after letting his secret slip. He loses his eccentric imagination. What should have happened: The two go to the park cloud busting together, and become best friends again - this time not in secret. What did happen: Sam goes cloud busting alone. Davey, telling no-one, slips away and leaves."
