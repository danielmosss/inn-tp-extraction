    "text": " The plot centers on Gang, a gang of four boys who play War, led by \"the Best Father\". All boys envy Andrew for having such a nice dad, while Paul's father is considered \"the worst father\", a reputation he was never able to shake off, after having told off Andrew's father for neglecting an accident that involved Matthew falling out of a tree. However, their revenge on Paul's father has to make way quickly for a much more serious operation. When Matthew dies of meningitis, and Andrew's father mentions the fact that Matthew's grandparents did not take him to the doctor's in time, the three boys decide to take revenge on them, blaming them for the death of their gang member. Matthew's grandparents, who became substitute parents for him and his sister Miranda, when their parents died in a car crash, are touched by the boys' helpful attitude towards them, and welcome them in their home, not knowing that they're the worst enemy they'll ever know. By then, Andrew, Paul and Peter have started calling them \"the Dinosaurs\", and their only goal is to \"have them extinct by Christmas\". A horrific battle ensues, and while Andrew and Paul start fighting for the leadership of Gang, things get out of control."
