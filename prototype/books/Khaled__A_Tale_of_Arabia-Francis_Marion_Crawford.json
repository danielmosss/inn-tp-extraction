    "text": " From the cover blurb of the Ballantine edition: \"Khaled is a hardworking, conscientious djinn, a true believer working industriously in the service of Allah. So industriously in fact that he rather oversteps the mark and causes the demise of a certain non-believer, and as a result, is condemned to being human for a while. In the company of a superlatively gorgeous princess, of course. \"She, However, in her own gentle, obedient and docile way (she is after all a true Arabian wife) is as stubborn as a mule...\" Khaled has no soul - but he is offered one chance: if his wife comes to love him, despite his lack of a soul, he will become fully human."
