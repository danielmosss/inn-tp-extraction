    "text": " The book starts with Jeff in need of a teaching robot. He buys Norby only to discover that it has the only mini-anti-gravity device in existence. They go to the park where the evil villain Ing's henchmen are after Fargo Wells, Jeff's brother. Norby and Jeff stop the henchmen who are captured by the police. Ing manages to take over Manhattan Island, but Norby and Jeff start a revolt against him. They go to the planet Jamya using a hyperdrive, never before done and creating a subplot for the second book in the series Norby's Other Secret. After enlisting Admiral Yobo in their quest to stop Ing, the three take Admiral Yobo's ship and, via hyperspace, literally park it above Ing's head, forcing him to a humiliating surrender. The book ends with Jeff saying Norby is his Mixed-Up Robot."
