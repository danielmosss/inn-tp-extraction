    "text": " Fred, 29, is a marine biologist working at the aquarium in Boston. She is a mermaid in the water, although she has legs on land. Her mother is human, but her biological father is a merman. Jonas, her thought-to-be-gay best friend, is the only one outside the family who knows the secret, until she is seen swimming in the fish tank by Thomas, a new employee at the aquarium. Prince Artur, a merman from the Black Sea, arrives to investigate the increased pollution in Boston Harbour and enlists the help of Fred and Thomas. They discover it to be a sewage waste problem caused by careless developers. Thomas and Prince Artur are rivals for Fred's affection, despite her abrasive manners and dismissive attitude to romance."
