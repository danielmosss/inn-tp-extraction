He then writes in a shuffled set of chapters, focusing on the \"perfect\" aspects of the iPod--the origins and the idea of the iPod, its ability to create an identity and a familiar community, its coolness factor, how it made music personal for individuals, and how it changed the music industry with Apple's iTunes Store. The book includes quotes, interviews, and anecdotes with such individuals as Apple's co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs; Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates; cultural anthropologist at the University of Utrecht and noted \"Professor of Cool,\" Dr. Carl Rohde; founder of MP3.com, Michael Robertson; and many others."
