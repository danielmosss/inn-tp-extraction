    "text": " Buck Duane is the son of a famous Texas gunman, a fact which brings him almost nothing but trouble. Duane shoots a man who threatens him and flees the law. He mixes with outlaws while clinging desperately to the last of his principles. He rescues a girl named Jennie from the hands of an outlaw king, but loses her in the escape. He then wanders aimlessly, desperation growing as the worth of life slips away."
