    "text": " The book's plot concerns two retired men who are thrown together following the deaths of their wives in the same hospital. Both have served in the armed forces, one, Reggie, being a former officer, the other, Roy, an ex-NCO. The perceived class differences lead to Roy moving in with Reggie and being treated as an unpaid servant. The reader's sympathies are with Roy as he remains humble and faithful to his purpose until Reggie becomes too domineering. Roy re-marries, and Reggie, whose attempt to seduce a younger widow, Liz, has ended in failure, is left alone."
