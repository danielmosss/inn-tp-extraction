    "text": " Following the savage Yuuzhan Vong conquest of Duro, Leia Organa Solo barely clings to life, having endured the vicious torture of the alien invaders. Her husband, Han Solo, rushes her to safety, but in a galaxy ready to blame the Jedi for the alien scourge, finding a refuge is nearly impossible. With bounty hunters in close pursuit, Solo has little choice but to head to Coruscant, but even the New Republic capital is no haven from anti-Jedi sentiment and treachery."
