    "text": " Pol Detson, son of Lord Det, has come home, now a powerful sorcerer of unsurpassed natural ability. But Pol is still an untrained talent, a \"madwand.\" To take control of his powers, to rule in his father's place, he must survive arduous training and a fantastic initiation into the rites of society. The story implied that a sequel was necessary to complete the story, but no sequel was ever written."
