She feels she has one chance to save him, the powerful Don DeMarco. The Don is respected and feared throughout the land. Many say he is gifted with strange powers, that all, even the beasts obey him. So she makes the arduous journey to his isolated palazzo. Once she is granted an audience with the Don and explains her plight, he agrees to help her on one condition: she must become his wife. Stunned but relieved she agrees and the plans are set into motion. For all her joy at saving her brother, there are powerful undercurrents of unease. It is said that there is a curse on the DeMarcos, that all marriages are doomed to fail, end in betrayal and murder."
