    "text": " The book's title is taken from a poem titled \"Reveille\" by A. E. Housman: Clay lies still, but blood's a rover; Breath's a ware that will not keep. Up, lad; when the journey's over There'll be time enough for sleep. Ellroy&#39;s literary agent, Sobel Weber Associates, posted a brief blurb for Blood's a Rover on its website in September 2008. It mentioned the novel&#39;s three protagonists and briefly outlined some of the novel&#39;s major plot points. These include the reappearance of Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, FBI infiltration into militant black power groups, Mafia activity in the Dominican Republic, and &#34;voodoo vibe in Haiti.&#34;"
