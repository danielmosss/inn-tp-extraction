    "text": " Lost Light is the first novel set after Bosch retires from the LAPD at the end of the prior story. Having received his private investigator's license, Bosch investigates an old case concerning the murder of a production assistant on the set of a film. The case leads him back into contact with his ex-wife Eleanor Wish, who is now a professional poker player in Las Vegas, and Bosch learns at the end that he and Eleanor have a young daughter. The poem referenced in this work is from Ezra Pound's \"Exile's Letter:\" What is the use of talking, and there is no end of talking, There is no end of things in the heart."
