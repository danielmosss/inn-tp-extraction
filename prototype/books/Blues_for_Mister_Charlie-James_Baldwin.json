    "text": " In a small Southern town, a white man murders a black man, then throws his body in the weeds. In the aftermath of Richard Henry's murder, the trial of store owner Lyle Britten gives way to a reflection upon racism in America. The play is loosely based on the Emmett Till murder that occurred in Money, Mississippi, before the Civil Rights Movement began. \"Mister Charlie\" is a phrase used by African Americans that refers to the white man."
