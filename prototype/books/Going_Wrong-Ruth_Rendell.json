    "text": " When he was a young man, Guy Curran led a local street gang and dealt drugs before falling madly in love with Lenora Chisholm, a much more middle-class teenager whose society minded parents naturally disapproved of him. However, despite an initially passionate romance the fairytale soon subsides, and Lenora tells a distraught Guy that she has found a new love. This announcement sets off a dark chain of events that will lead Guy into obsession, stalking and finally murder."
