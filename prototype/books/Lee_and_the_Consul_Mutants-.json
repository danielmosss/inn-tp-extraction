    "text": " It is not every day that a part of your body explodes. But ten-year-old Lee's appendix does just that, landing him in hospital. After his operation, Lee discovers that being in hospital has its bright side. But his world turns dark again when he uncovers a fiendish plot by the white-coated Consul Mutants to take over the world. Other kids might quake in their boots at this news, but not Lee. He is determined to save the planet and formulates a cunning plan to stop the alien invasion. Lee and the Consul Mutants is the story of a fearless boy battling against intergalactic odds for the sake of mankind. Leeâ€™s only weapon is his intelligence . . . which is a pity."
