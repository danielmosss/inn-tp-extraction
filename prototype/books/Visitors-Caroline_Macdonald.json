    "text": " Lately, while patrolling, Buffy's been getting the distinct impression that she's being stalked by a demon that emits a high pitched giggle. After discussion and research with Giles, they discover that Buffy's being stalked by a 'korred'; a nasty hairy beast that feeds on peoples life forces by making them dance to his magical song until they die. The korred is particularly attracted to Buffy because of her Slayer aura. Buffy must stop to korred before he makes her dance to her death."
