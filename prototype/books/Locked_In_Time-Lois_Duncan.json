    "text": " Seventeen-year-old Nore Robbins is less than thrilled when her father, Chuck, remarries. After all, her mother hasn't even been gone for a year yet, and there's something odd and sinister about his new wife, Lisette. Besides the fact that Lisette Berge is much too young to have teenage children, Nore's stepsister, Josie, has a habit of making strange comments about her family being \"stuck where they are\" and time \"not counting for anything.\"Josie also has a precocious manner, flirts with boys, and wears too much makeup.She hesitates to pry into the matter. When Nore discovers Lisette's old diaries in the shed&mdash;some dating back to the 19th century&mdash;she realizes that she and her father are in terrible danger. The question is, can they leave Shadow Grove without meeting the very fate the Berges have worked so hard to bring on them?"
