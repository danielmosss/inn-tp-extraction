    "text": " On the way from Thebes with his father, the scribe Amunhoben points out the ruins of Akhetaten, the city that the \"heretic pharaoh\" Akhenaten built for his One and Only God. Seeking a balanced perspective on the events of that time, which split Egypt politically and religiously, Meriamun gets a letter of introduction from his father to many members of Akhenaten's court, among them the High Priest of Amun, his chief of security Haremhab, and his queen Nefertiti. Each tale adds a new dimension to the enigma that is Akhenaten and the thoughts of those that were close to him allow Meriamun &ndash; and the reader &ndash; to judge for themselves whether Akhenaten was a power politician or a true believer."
