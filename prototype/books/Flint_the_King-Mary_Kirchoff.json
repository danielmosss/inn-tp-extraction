    "text": " Flint The King is set in the five years before Dragons of Autumn Twilight where the Heroes of the Lance split up and look for signs of gods returning and a new evil stirring in the world. Flint Fireforge returns to his sleepy boyhood village in the foothills near Solace to discover that everything has changed. The village is now prosperous and producing weapons for an unknown buyer. When Flint starts poking around he is discovered and pushed into the \"Beast Pit\" and expected to die. He is rescued by a group of Gully Dwarves who make him their king. Flint struggles to bring the gully dwarves together and form a fighting force so that he can escape and use them to foil the enemies' plans."
