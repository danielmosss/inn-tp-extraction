    "text": " One day, George is left alone at his house, and of course he is curious. As he is looking out the window he sees a tiny house he wants to explore. Curious George jumps out the window, crawls over a fence and makes his way to the small house he sees. Inside the house are many bunny rabbits, and George accidentally lets one out. He struggles for a bit but finally is able to get the bunny back into the house. As he is walking back, he sees a man fishing and wants to join. As George is trying to fish, he falls in and a neighbor boy named Bill comes to help him as he gets out of the water. Bill is very friendly and wants to show George his new kite. George loves the kite and Bill trusts George to watch the kite while he leaves to get his bicycle. Of course, George is curious so he begins to fly the kite. At first he thinks it will be OK but soon the kite takes off, along with George. Curious George flies high up in the sky, and has to be rescued by the Man in the Yellow Hat in a helicopter. He returns the kite to Bill who then rewards George with his very own pet bunny from the bunny house he explored in the beginning of the book."
