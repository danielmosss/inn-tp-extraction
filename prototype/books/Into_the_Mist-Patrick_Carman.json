    "text": " Before the walls went up... before the battle between Abaddon and Elyon... before Alexa Daley was born... there were two young brothers, Thomas and Roland Warvold, whose pasts were as mysterious as their futures. Raised in a horrible orphanage and forced to escape into a strange, unknown world, Thomas and Roland found adventure wherever they turned-and danger wherever they looked. Their story is one of magic, exploration, fellowship, and secrets-all of which need to be revealed as the chronicles of Elyon unfold."
