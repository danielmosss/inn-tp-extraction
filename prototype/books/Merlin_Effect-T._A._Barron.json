    "text": " Kate Gordon travels to a remote lagoon in California, hoping to help her father discover a sunken ship that disappeared centuries ago. In time, she learns that the ship may have carried a mysterious drinking horn out of Arthurian legend, which possibly ended Merlin himself.. As she explores alone in her kayak, Kate encounters several pieces of the puzzle: a terrible whirlpool, a group of ever-singing whales, a seemingly ageless fish, and a prophecy that, under certain conditions, the ancient ship may rise and sail again. She plunges into an undersea world of bizarre creatures and terrifying foes. But to save the life of her father, she must find some way to regain her own free will, and to succeed where even Merlin failed."
