    "text": " Mary Jack is in the foster home of a conscientious but clueless Episcopal priest, Father Matt, and his selfish troubled wife Jill. Also in their care is the silent Jane, a young girl who had been abused. The house becomes further troubled by the introduction of an older boy, Adam; but when Matt's injured sister comes to live with them, Jill threatens to leave. In order to save his marriage, Matt sends the children and his sister to live in a cabin in the mountains, supposedly with the help of a mean housekeeper who abandons them. They must learn to be self-sufficient or risk being taken away to unknown fates. Along the way, they discover just how much it takes to make a family."
