    "text": " \"Hey, Al\" is the story of a janitor named Al and his dog, Eddie. Al and Eddie had hard lives, but one day a bird offered to carry them to a magnificent island in the sky. When they arrived, Al and Eddie found it to be a paradise. However, strange things began to happen. Al and Eddie began to resemble birds and they realised the paradise was not all it appeared to be. Al and Eddie wished to return home so they decided to escape by using their newly acquired wings to fly home. Their flight did not go to plan as Eddie crashed into the sea and was lost. Fortunately, Eddie was able to swim home to Al. Al and Eddie were happy to return home."
