    "text": " Gracie Kenzie has never known her father - he disappeared when she was three and was never heard from again. Now, two years after her mother's death, he's back... with some dark secrets in tow. His and Gracie's histories are mysteriously tied to the disappearance of a student many years ago... and may also be linked to a much more recent death. This would be enough for any girl to deal with, but Gracie is not just any girl. She has premonitions - about the past, the present, and the future. With the help of her cousin, Diego, she solves the murders and reveals the secrets of a few dark pasts! This is the second in the series. The first one is called Premonitions."
