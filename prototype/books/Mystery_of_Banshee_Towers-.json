    "text": " During a holiday from school, the children are told by their parents to spend their time visiting sites in the adjacent countryside, rather than spend their time in the village (searching for a mystery to solve). Together, they visit an old stately home which is hosting some famous sea paintings, which Ern and Little Bets love and the others can take or leave. The plot hinges on the fact that Ern spots that on subsequent visits a little boat he particularly admired in the piece de resistance of the collection is missing, and that on pointing this out to the crusty curator and volatile owner the children unknowingly place themselves in great danger . Ern find the first clue a clue that nobody would have noticed."
