    "text": " On Qualavarra, humanity was enslaved by the Vorra, a race of technologically-advanced barbarians who had conquered space. However, there was a place called \"The Acre\" where humans lived in relative freedom, and there they had uncovered a secret about the Vorra: there was something connected with Earth that the Vorra could not abideâ€”and yet could not do without."
