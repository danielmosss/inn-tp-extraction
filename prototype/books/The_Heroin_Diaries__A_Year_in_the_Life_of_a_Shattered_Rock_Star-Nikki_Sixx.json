    "text": " The book is a 413-page collection of diary entries written between Christmas of 1986 and Christmas of 1987. In considerable detail, the diaries chronicle the recording of Mötley Crüe's Girls, Girls, Girls album and the subsequent Girls Girls Girls tour, ending with Sixx's near-death from a heroin overdose in late 1987, which inspires the band to quit heroin altogether. Themes include Sixx's relationships with then-girlfriend Vanity, the other members of Mötley Crüe, and his family, as well as his drug dependency. Sixx's dark struggles with addiction and depression are leavened by humorous anecdotes about his wild lifestyle at the time."
