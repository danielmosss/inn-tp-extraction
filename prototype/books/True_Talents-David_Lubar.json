Trash can move things with his mind; Flinch can predict the future; Lucky finds lost objects; Cheater reads minds; Torchie is a fire-starter and Martin can see into people's souls. They are now back home with their loved ones and are trying to get back to their normal lives, start attending high school and keeping in touch with their Edgeview friends. When Trash tests his power in the bank, accidentally stealing fistfuls of cash, he is kidnapped by a ruthless leader of an unknown organization trying to gather info on psychic phenomena and willing to do anything to get it. Martin and his friends team up to and use their hidden talents to rescue their friend while each figure out their own true talent in the process."
