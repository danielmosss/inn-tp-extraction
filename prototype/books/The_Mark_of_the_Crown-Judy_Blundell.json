    "text": " The Queen of Gala is dying. Her son, Prince Beju, wants to take the control of the whole planet no matter the consequences. Young Jedi apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, must find another heir to the throne to avoid a war. They must use a special device known as the \"Mark of the Crown\" to prove that Beju is not the rightful heir. The mission ends with successful elections, though Beju nearly compromises the Jedi's mission, as he almost did on Phindar."
