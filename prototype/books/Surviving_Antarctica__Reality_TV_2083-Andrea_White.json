    "text": " Surviving Antarctica takes place in the year 2083 in a television-crazed country of United States. The Secretary of \"Entertainment\" is the Head of the Department of Entertainment or the DOE. Public schools shut down and are replaced with \"Edu-TV\" which are lessons with Interactive Quizzes on a television screen. It is mandatory and only goes up to Eighth Grade. After completing the required Eighth Year of Edu-TV, one must pay for High School and College. In the year 2083, America is awfully poor and very bad in the economy. People live in shacks similar to Hoovervilles during the Great Depression. So to pay for further education, a few sponsored scholarships are given out. The most popular is \"The Toss\" which is a game of pure chance. The administer calls out a number, and the 14 year-old wishing for the full scholarship rolls two dice, hoping it will land on that number. In Edu-TV the Social Studies/History show is called \"Historical Survivor\". The Secretary of DOE (aka \"Hot Sauce\" by her employees) gathers a \"lucky few\" to re-enact parts of history. The five kids (Robert, Polly, Grace, Andrew, and Billy) see an advertisement by the Secretary of Entertainment for a new Historical Survivor Series that features kids. It is called \"Historical Survivor: Antarctica\". She offers $10,000 to whoever is chosen to re-enact the expedition of Robert F. Scott and an extra $90,000 to the MVP (most valuable player). They had to fill out an application to be eligible. These five kids (out of about 4,000 applicants) made it, unlike most of the others. Unbeknownst to them, however, the Secretary has placed mini camcorders in the eyes to film instead of a camera crew. Hot Sauce also planned different calamities to happen to the kids on their journey that also happened to Scott. But a group of night shift employees engage in acts of sabotage to help the kids on their way. All five come from completely different backgrounds and walks of life, but will have to cooperate to survive Antarctica. Through a series of tragedies and misfortunes, they end up in the middle of nowhere, frostbitten and hungry. But will they get help from the one person nobody would expect- the camera crews?"
