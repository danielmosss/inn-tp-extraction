    "text": " On a bitterly cold March night in Montreal, Temperance is exhuming the remains of a nun proposed for sainthood in the grounds of a church. Hours later she's called to the scene of an horrific arson, where a young family has perished. There seem to be no witnesses, motive and no explanation. From the charred remains of the inferno to a trail of sinister cult activity and a terrifying showdown during an ice storm. Tempe faces a test of both her forensic expertise and her survival instinct."
