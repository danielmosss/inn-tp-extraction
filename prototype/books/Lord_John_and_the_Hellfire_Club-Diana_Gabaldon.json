Gerald asks Grey to meet him in secret that night, hinting at intrigue. Before the meeting, however, Gerald is killed in front of Grey and Quarry, and the two men begin to search for clues pertaining to Gerald's murder. A few days later, during a high-society party, Grey is invited to a Hellfire Club meeting by one of its members, George Everett (one of Grey's former lovers).
