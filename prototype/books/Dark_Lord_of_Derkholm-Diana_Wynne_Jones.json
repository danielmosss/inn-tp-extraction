    "text": " A fantasy world is dominated by its destructive tourist industry. \"Mr. Chesney's Pilgrim Parties\" arrange for annual group tours, evidently from our world, to experience all the cliches: wise Wizard Guides, attacks from Leathery-Winged Avians, the Glamorous Enchantress, the evil Dark Lord. It is a devastating show: farmlands are laid waste, people slain, and so on. The head of Wizards University, Querida, determines a way to end the tours. The apparently incompetent wizard Derk will be the next Dark Lord, wife Mara the next Glamorous Enchantress, and son Blade the Wizard Guide for the final tour. She overcomes objections all around and the plan is underway."
