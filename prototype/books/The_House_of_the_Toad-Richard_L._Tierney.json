He soon discovers himself the focus of a conspiracy of ancient cults. Various of the evil characters are servitors of the Primal Ones, incredibly ancient and powerful entities which sowed life throughout the universe and caused it to evolve both intelligence and the capacity to suffer.

The God 'Ghanta' is in the story is hinted to be identical to the Ghatanothoa of Lovecraft's story Out of the Aeons. S.T.
