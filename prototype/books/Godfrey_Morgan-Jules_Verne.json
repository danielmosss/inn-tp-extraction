    "text": " Godfrey, an idle twenty-two-year-old, lives with his uncle, the wealthy Lord William W. Kolderup. Prior to marrying the young and pretty Phina, he asked to undertake a sea voyage of two years. Acceding to his desire, his uncle sends him around the world on board the Dream, commanded by Captain Turcott, with his mentor, teacher, and dance instructor, Professor T. Artelett aka \"Tartlet\". Unfortunately, the ship sinks a few miles from an island where Godfrey will have to learn to survive, to organize his life, face the savages, and overcome other obstaclesâ€”together with Tartlet, the only other survivor of the sinking Dream. Faced with this, the jaded young man discovers the value of effort and gains poise and courage."
