    "text": " It is 2382. Archaeologists land on Akoshemon's only moon, along with the Doctor and his companions. They uncover an entity that was seemingly there when Akoshemon destroyed itself in violence; it glories in death and destruction and tries to start more. It seems to have the ability to mentally influence people."
