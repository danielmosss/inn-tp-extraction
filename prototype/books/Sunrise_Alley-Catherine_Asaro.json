    "text": " After barely surviving a ship wreck, Turner and Sam set out on a series of adventures to try to discover who the mysterious \"Charon\" is (the former jailer of Turner) and what/where exactly \"Sunrise Alley\" is. Unsure of whom to trust, the characters manage a series of escapes, eventually discovering the truth behind Turner's existence and his captor. Both characters explore the notion of humanity and machine intelligence, and eventually come to blur the distinction, with the apparent realization that humanity and machine technology will inevitably merge. In the process they also fall in love."
