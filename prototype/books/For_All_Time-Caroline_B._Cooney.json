    "text": " Charles Lattimer (Mark Harmon) is an everyday man facing middle age and a marriage (to Catherine Hicks) coming to an end. He stumbles across a time slip that occurs on one of his regular train rides, as the train goes through a tunnel. Coming across an antique watch, he learns it allows him to get off the train during the time slip, whereupon he finds himself back in the 1890s. Before long he finds a new found love, played by Mary McDonnell, and a new purpose there. The watch gets broken and complications occur when the portal back to the past starts to close, leading him to a decision that could leave him stranded out of his own time.
