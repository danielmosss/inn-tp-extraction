    "text": " Red Army was unique among military fiction published in the United States during the 1980s, in that it told its story exclusively from the perspective of officers and men in the Soviet Army. Even more uniquely, the Soviet Union prevailed over NATO forces thanks to a combination of rapid military success and political strategy. No other technothriller by the authors in the genre — such as Tom Clancy, Harold Coyle, Dale Brown, or Sir John Hackett — presented an opfor perspective for the entire book or victory at the end of the novel. It was also unique for the genre in that the author did not focus at all on detailed descriptions of the weapons and technology used, and instead concentrated on the characters and their respective stories in the conflict. ru:Красная армия (роман)"
