    "text": " The plot concerns the Rebecca Riots in the 19th century. The action is seen through the eyes of young Jethro Mortymer.It is based on the true events of the Rebecca Riots in which the people of West Wales protested against the toll gate charges of the business men and land owners of the time. The Rebecca name refers to the leader of the campaign, which was a man dressing in women's attire to protect his identity. On reading the book you understand the reasons for such protests and its manner. The book is a worthy sequel to The Rape of the Fair Country."
