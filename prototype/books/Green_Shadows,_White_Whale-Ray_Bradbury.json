    "text": " The narrator, an unnamed writer, is sent to Dublin, Ireland to coproduce a film adaptation of Moby Dick with a director whose first name is given as \"John\". While there, he hears of the many strange and surreal stories of the boyos in Flinn's pub that make up the bulk of the novel, along with other adventures in the land of Ireland, including a \"hunt wedding\" and a house that has a mind of its own. The last chapter of the novel is devoted to the successful completion of the screenplay and the narrator's resulting ascent to fame."
