Buddy decides enough is enough and forms a plan to get Mr King arrested, it involves keeping his dad away from 56 Croxley Street long enough for Mr King to enter 56 (he does this by convincing his mum to go and see his dad). Then, Charmian has to telephone the police and tell them someone is breaking in to 56 and wait for Mr King to get arrested. However, Buddy finds Mr King leaves Croxley Street before the police arrive. Later, his dad arrives on his bike leaving Buddy to find out him and his mum didn't work out.
