    "text": " Lou Arrendale is a bioinformatics specialist, and high-functioning autistic, who has made a good life for himself. A new manager at the firm where he works puts pressure on the department where many autistic people work. Lou is pressured to undergo an experimental treatment that might \"cure\" his autism. Lou does not think he needs curing, but he risks losing his job and other accommodations the company has put in place for its autistic employees. Lou struggles with the idea of going through this \"treatment\" for his autism while he pursues fencing with \"normal\" friends and continues to go to work. His autistic friends, as well as himself, meet together after work and discuss what or what not to do."
