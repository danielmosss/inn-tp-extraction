A box of crackers is sent to the room with a death threat inside. Tim and Nick are shocked to hear that Minerva hates Christmas and everything about it, but agree to be at the event to protect her. At Regent Street the next day, someone fires two shots. In the ensuing commotion, Tim accidentally turns on the lights, spoiling the ceremony. However, now that they are on, Harold easily spots someone on one of the rooftops, holding what looks like a gun. Nick rushes to the rooftop via the store below, but only hears the supposed assassin say \"I d-d-didn't...\" before he runs away. Chase fires Tim. Then Nick explains that Chase wanted to kill Minerva due to her hatred of Christmas. He faked the death threat and to avoid suspicion, hired a private detective (Tim), while at the same time making sure that he was dumb and half-witted. Then, he paid Parker to go up on the rooftops, but fired some blanks from his pocket. Then, he killed Parker since he knew he was working as the Harrods Santa, Nick realises Tim's card fell out of his pocket during the fight. He took his place, and began waiting till Minerva would visit, then he would give her the bomb.
