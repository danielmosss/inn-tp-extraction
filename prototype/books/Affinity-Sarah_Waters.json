    "text": " Margaret Prior (also called \"Peggy\" and \"Aurora\"), an unmarried woman from an upper-class family, visits the Millbank Prison in the 1870s Victorian era England. The protagonist is an overall unhappy person, recovering from her father's death and her subsequent failed suicide attempt and struggling with her lack of power living at home with her over-involved mother despite being almost 30. She becomes a \"Lady Visitor\" of the prison, hoping to escape her troubles and be a guiding figure in the lives of the female prisoners. As she peers through a flap in the door, entranced by the sight of a young woman with a flower, she is reminded of a Carlo Crivelli painting. Of all her friendships with prisoners, she is most fascinated by this woman, who she learns to be Selina Dawes, medium of spirits."
