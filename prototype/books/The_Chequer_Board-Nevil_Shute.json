    "text": " It is a multi-part story telling of the experience of one John (Jackie) Turner, whom the doctors have given just one year to live due to injuries sustained in a wartime plane crash. Turner decides to use his remaining time to trace the men he got to know while recovering in hospital. The men were: *Flying Officer Phillip Morgan - the plane's British pilot. *Corporal Duggie Brent - a young British Commando, accused of murder. *Pfc Dave Lesurier - a black American serviceman, accused of attempted rape, in hospital after cutting his own throat while being pursued. As the story unfolds, we learn that charges against Lesurier were dropped after an Army investigation and that he later returned to the English town near which he was stationed during the war. He marries the girl he was courting and becomes a draughtsman. Brent is also acquitted of murder but served six months for manslaughter after a brilliantly defended court-martial - he is later found living close to Lesurier and working as a meat vendor. Morgan relocates to Burma and becomes a successful businessman, married into a strong local community. Turner is contented by the thought that each man, who had helped with his recovery after the plane crash, had managed to make a good life in his own way. The novel ends with what will be his last visit to the medical specialist. Underlying the novel is the Buddhist belief in reincarnation and redemption. Although a thief and someone with a shady past, it is indicated that Turner, through his attempts to help his fellow passengers and his acceptance of his death, has attained Nirvana."
