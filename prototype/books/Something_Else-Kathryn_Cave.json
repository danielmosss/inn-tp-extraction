    "text": " Something Else (the name of the protagonist) is excluded from everything because he looks different. He does not play the same games, eat the same food or draw the same pictures. Then one day Something turns up and wants to be friends. However, Something Else does not want to be friends with this creature as he believes that they are not the same and he refuses to eat sandwiches with 'Urgy stuff' in them. He sends Something away and then suddenly realizes that he acts like all the other people who always sent him away. Eventually Something Else and Something become best friends."
