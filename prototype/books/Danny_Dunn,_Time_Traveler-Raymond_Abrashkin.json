    "text": " Professor Bullfinch's experiment with a time travel invention is being secretly observed by Danny, Joe, and Irene. The youngsters are startled by the appearance of a second Joe. During the following confusion, the time travel device transports them all into the past. Aided by Benjamin Franklin, the Professor works to return them to their present. In the meantime, the youngsters explore the society of American life under British rule, only to find one of their number in danger of being marooned in the past."
