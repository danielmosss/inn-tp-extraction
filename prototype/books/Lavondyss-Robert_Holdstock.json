    "text": " During her formative years, Tallis encounters the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams (not a mythago, but real flesh and blood). Tallis sings him a song that she thinks she has made up herself, but the composer identifies its tune as that of a folk song he has collected personally in Norfolk. Slowly Tallis's links with the wood intensify. She makes ten chthonic wooden masks, each of which represents one of the ten first legends in Ryhope wood. Within the context of the story, these masks are talismans that help to engage certain parts of her subconscious and so link her with the characters and landscapes which are forming within the wood. When properly used (especially later in the book), these masks allow Tallis to see things that cannot be seen without them, and they can also be used to create 'Hollowings' — pathways in space and time which allow her to step into far-off places within the wood which would otherwise take days, weeks, or even months to travel to on foot. Tallis makes the masks in the following order: # The Hollower — made from elm, this female mask is painted red & white. # Gaberlungi — made from oak and painted white, this mask is known as \"memory of the land\". # Skogen — made from hazel and painted green, this mask is known as \"shadow of the forest\". # Lament — made from willow bark, this simple mask is painted gray. # Falkenna — the first of three journey masks is painted like a hawk; this mask is known as \"the flight of a bird into an unknown region\". # Silvering — the second of three journey masks is painted in colored circles; this mask is known as \"the movement of a salmon into the rivers of an unknown region\". The Silvering is also the name of a short story included in Merlin's Wood. # Cunhaval — the third of three journey masks is made from elder wood; this mask is known as \"the running of a hunting dog through the forest tracks of an unknown region\". # Moondream — made from beechwood, this mask is painted with moon symbols on its face. This mask plays a prominent role in The Hollowing. # Sinisalo — made from wych elm and painted white and azure, this mask is known as \"seeing the child in the land\". # Morndun — this mask appears dead from the front, but alive from behind and is known as \"the first journey of a ghost into an unknown region\". Before setting foot in the wood, Tallis has one particular encounter that has major repercussions through the rest of the story: with the 'help' of one of the mythagos, she 'hollows' (creates a Hollowing) and observes Scathach, a young warrior, dying on a battlefield beneath a tree. Tallis' misdirected magic used to help this young warrior changes both her story and Harry Keeton's story in Ryhope wood. Deep within Ryhope wood Tallis eventually meets up with Edward Wynne-Jones (human, not mythago) who was only mentioned in Mythago Wood. He is now living in the wood as a shaman to a small village of ancient people. Through his understanding of the wood (which he studied with the scientist George Huxley from the first book), Tallis herself gains an understanding of her connections with all that surrounds her; most importantly, she asks him how she might find her lost brother Harry Keeton."
