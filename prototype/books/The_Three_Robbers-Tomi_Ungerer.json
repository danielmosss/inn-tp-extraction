There is only a lonely girl named Tiffany on her way to live with a wicked aunt, so the robbers carry Tiffany off to their hideout. When Tiffany sees all of the treasure the robbers have collected, she asks what it is for, and the robbers have no answer. Later the robbers decide to open an orphanage with their wealth and all uncared children go to live there. In October 2008 Phaidon Press Inc. will release an English language edition of the book."
