    "text": " Jonathon Payne and David \"D.J.\" Jones are recruited to find Dr. Charles Boyd, an archeologist who recently found the Catacombs of Orvieto, the safe haven for the popes of the Middle Ages. While Boyd avoids pursuit, a series of victims turn up dead, people who were tortured and crucified like Jesus Christ on his final day. All the incidents are interconnected, but itâ€™s up to Payne and Jones to figure out the common thread and why they were selected to solve the puzzle."
