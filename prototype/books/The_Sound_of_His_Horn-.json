    "text": " British naval lieutenant Alan Querdillon becomes a POW during the Battle of Crete during World War II. He awakens in a Nazi controlled world 102 years after World War II. He is hunted (literally) by a \"Reichsforester\" (a title Hermann Göring had during the Third Reich). He takes refuge with genetically mutilated \"undesirables\" — one of the first fictional descriptions of genetic manipulation."
