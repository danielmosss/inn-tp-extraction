    "text": " For while the protagonist, Hans van den Broek, chooses cricket as his refuge, there's a lot more going on here than the \"sport of gentlemen\". Hans is an immigrant â€” Dutch-born and now residing in Manhattan, with his wife and young son. He's desperate to fit in and goes through the whole rigmarole of gaining his US drivers' license, if only to become that little bit more embedded in the culture. Connecting with people who play cricket in New York is yet another way he can \"connect\", albeit with an immigrant underclass. And, tellingly, the one man with whom he forges a tentative friendship, Chuck Ramkissoon, winds up being pulled out of a New York canal with his hands tied behind his back."
