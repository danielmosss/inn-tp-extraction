    "text": " High above a troubled China, where animals battle machines for control, floats an intricate web of hot air balloons â€“ the Sky Village. When twelve-year-old Mei Long's mother is kidnapped, her father sends Mei to live in the sky, surrounded by strangers, amid a growing threat. Half a world away, thirteen-year-old Rom Saint-Pierre struggles to survive in beast-controlled Las Vegas. When his young sister is stolen away by a pair of demonic creatures, Rom has no choice but to follow them into a shadowy underground world. He becomes enmeshed in gladiator-style arena fighting, in which battles between mechanical-beast demons entertain a chaotic community of gamblers. Mei and Rom have never met, but they share connected journals, books that mysteriously allow them to communicate. The journals also reveal that each of them carries the strange and terrifying Kaimira gene, entwining beast and mek qualities in their very DNA. In this intricately plotted novel, the first in a five-book series, Mei and Rom must overcome those forces that seek to destroy them, and find the courage to balance the powers that clash within. It is their only hope for survival, and for saving the ones they love."
