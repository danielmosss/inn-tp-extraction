He wishes to hire Dr Cooper to retrieve valuable artwork from Central America that were recovered from the tomb of Toco-Rey, an Olteca king who died nearly 1200 years ago. Dr Ben Cory was sent to find the city, following a map left by Jose de Carlon, who rediscovered the city in 1536, but whose men succumbed to madness shortly thereafter. Cory is also missing."
