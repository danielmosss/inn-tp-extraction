    "text": " A dark, even bleak, novel, Let It Come Down follows American Nelson Dyar as he arrives in the International Zone of Tangier, Morocco to begin a new job and a new life. Dyar's exploration of the brothels, drugs and unsavoury characters of Tangier leads him gradually, logically, to a sinister conclusion. Bowles took the book's title from Macbeth III.3, just before Banquo is murdered: :Banquo: It will be rain to-night. :1st. Murd.: Let it come down. :(They set upon Banquo.) The author has described the line as an ‘admirable four-word sentence, succinct and brutal’."
