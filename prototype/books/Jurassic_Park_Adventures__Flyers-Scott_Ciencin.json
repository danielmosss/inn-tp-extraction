    "text": " The story is unusual in that it is told partially from the animal's point of view. The Pteranodons that escaped Sorna have been spotted all around the world and now they are in Florida. Coincidentally, Alan Grant and Eric Kirby are invited to go to the Universal Studios in Orlando to talk about their adventures on the islands. Unfortunately, the Pteranodons are attracted by the lakes in the park and decide to stay there, wreaking havoc and injuring people by flying off with them and throwing them to the water. With the help of Amanda Kirby and a reporter named Manly Wilks, Alan and Eric try to capture the Pteranodons to get them back to the island before they are culled by Florida's authorities. The Pteranodons manage to destroy some of the park's attractions and kill two helicopter pilots, before they are finally caught. Manly then tries to get one of them to become famous, but Amanda punches him out cold and all reptiles are returned to the island, by means of tricking them to follow an aircraft disguised as a Pteranodon."
