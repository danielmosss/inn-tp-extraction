    "text": " A famous painting by the Italian maestro Tintoretto is gifted to the Niyogi family by the aristocratic Italian Cassini family. However, not everyone is aware of the value of the painting. One of the family members(disguised) steals it, and international buyers are interested in it. Feluda chases the criminals all the way to Hong Kong. There was a surprise waiting for him there. Eventually, Feluda (with the help of a relative stranger,who turns out to be a Niyogi family member) succeeds in solving the mystery. The native princes play an interesting part in the history of British India. Though under the protection of the British Raj, they had a certain amount of power within their domain. Apart from patronizing cricket in India, many of them were involved in promoting social and cultural activities in India. In 'Tintorettor Jishu' we meet the (fictional) ex-Maharaja of Bhagwanagarh, Mr. Bhudev Singh. Another ex Maharaja Suraj Singh appears in 'Golapi Mukta Rahashya'. The young prince of Rupnaryangarh plays an important role in 'Eber Kando Kedarnathe'. However, the maharajas and the princes are more prominent in the 'Tarini Khuro' series, another creation of Satyajit Ray."
