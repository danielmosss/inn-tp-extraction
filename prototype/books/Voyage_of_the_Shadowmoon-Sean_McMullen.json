Their task is to retrieve Silverdeath, an apocalyptic mechanism that has been hidden for decades. Unearthed by the ambitious Emperor Warsovran, Silverdeath annihilates an entire continent. The Shadowmoon's crew, some of whom are working for different parties, are trying to secure Silverdeath before it can be used again by any of a host of rulers who wish to abuse its destructive abilities."
