    "text": " Years after Immanuel Kant published his Critique of Pure Reason but now rumours say that the philosophers is about to release another book. This book will be different than all others because it will examine the concept of serial killers. Meanwhile the German city of KÃ¶nigsberg, where Kant lives, is gripped by a series of murders. Prosecutor Hanno Stiffeniis is ordered by King Frederick William III himself to investigate the crimes and bring the murderer to justice. Stiffeniis is aided in his quest by Immanuel Kant, as well as a local police sergeant. eo:Kritiko de kriminala racio"
