    "text": " The novel follows two initially separate narratives set in the United Kingdom and Eastern Europe. Recently separated - at the age of 33 - conjoined twins Blair Albert and Gordon-Marie \"Bunny\" Heath struggle to cope with life in a post-globalisation and fully privatised London. Meanwhile, Ludmila Derev, an impoverished young woman living in the war-torn Southern Caucasus, leaves her mountain home to meet up with her boyfriend in the region's major town and send money back to her family. However, things start to go wrong and she ends up with her picture on a Russian Brides website. Slowly her life and those of the twins are drawn together."
