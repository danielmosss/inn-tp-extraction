    "text": " Den Haag is the faction (fact+fiction) which is based on the historical fact of the Korean Empire's credential three secret delegates at the Second Peace Conference at The Hague (Den Haag in Dutch) in 1907. This story mingles three different incidents crossing time and space. In 1907, at The Hague, Yi Jun, one of the three delegates died a mysterious death. In 2007, in Seoul, a 10 year old child died from an ill-defined brain disease. These two stories are linked together through the letter to the Vatican sent by a veiled priest called 'Q' and his activities. This novel call our of today to account what is the historical meaning of Japan-Korea Forced Annexation a hundred years ago: Who am I, what left behind 'a time of Japanese forced occupation' to me of the present time, and in confronting such historical problems, how to eliminate the legacy of Japanâ€™s colonial rule of Korea which have been restricting liberty and pride of Korean even now."
