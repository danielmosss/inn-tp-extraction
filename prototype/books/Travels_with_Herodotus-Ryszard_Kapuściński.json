    "text": " Beginning in Kapuściński's student years, the books shows us how Kapuściński rose to the rare position of global correspondent for a Polish newspaper and follows him through his journeys in the Middle East and Africa (though he sometimes skips from one time another to draw allusions from Herodotus). The book by Herodotus was given to him as a 'present for the road' by his chief editor when he was leaving for his first foreign assignment in India."
