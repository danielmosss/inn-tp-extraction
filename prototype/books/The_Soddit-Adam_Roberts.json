    "text": " The story starts with a peaceful Soddit called Bingo who is visited by a wizard and a party of dwarfs who ask Bingo to come with them on a quest to 'The Only Mountain' where 'Smug the Dragon' lives. After a few drinks, Bingo accepts, not knowing what they were actually searching for. \"Gold, boyo gold, la, look you.\" On the way, they have many adventures and close shaves. Bingo finds a 'Thing®' that was created by the Evil Sharon and is potentially the most evil Thing® in the world. Bingo steals the Thing® and continues to escort the dwarfs and the hastily sickening wizard to the only mountain, where horror strikes."
