    "text": " Trixie steps lively as she goes with her father to the laundromat, down the block, through the park, past the school, to the Laundromat. For the toddler, loading and putting money into the machine invoke wide-eyed pleasure. But, on the return home, she realizes that her stuffed bunny has been left behind. Because she cannot talk, Trixie cannot explain why she is upset to her daddy. Despite his plea of \"please don't get fussy,\" she gives it her all, bawling and going \"boneless.\" They both arrive home unhappy. Mom immediately sees that \"Knuffle Bunny\" is missing. After several tries, dad finds the toy among the wet laundry and reclaims hero status. The toddler exuberantly exclaims, \"Knuffle Bunny!!!\" Those were the first words Trixie ever said. This book was also made into a musical (Knuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Tale) by Mo Williams, Michael Silversher, and Deborah Wicks La Puma. It toured with the Kennedy Center to cities all across the United States. http://www.kennedy-center.org/events/?event=KKTBD"
