    "text": " Molôn Labé!, the free state movement's first novel, has encouraged many people to relocate to Wyoming for their own immediate increase in personal freedom, as well as for long-term hopes of bolstering the general climate of liberty in the Cowboy State. Molon labe is an ancient Greek expression for \"Come and take them!\", the defiant reply of King Leonidas to the Persian demand before the Battle of Thermopylae for his 300 Spartans to lay down their arms in surrender. In the United States, the phrase is becoming a modern-day Second Amendment cry of resolve never to disarm in the face of compulsion."
