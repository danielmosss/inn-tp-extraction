    "text": " Nathan Zuckerman is a promising young writer who spends a night in the home of E.I. Lonoff, an established author whom Zuckerman idolizes (and who, it has been argued, is a portrait of Bernard Malamud or Henry Roth or a composite of both). Also staying in the Lonoff home is Amy Bellette, a young woman with a vague past whom the narrator apparently comes to suspect as being Anne Frank, living in the United States anonymously, having survived the Holocaust. It only becomes apparent at the end of this section that this conjecture is part of a fiction composed by Zuckerman."
