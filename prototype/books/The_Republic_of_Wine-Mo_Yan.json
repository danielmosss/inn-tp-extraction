    "text": " ;1 :Ong Gou'er, 48-year-old special investigator, gets a lift with a \"lady trucker\" (that he is quite taken with) to the Mount Luo Coal Mine, Liquorland (a fictional Chinese province), where he has been sent to investigate claims of cannibalism: claims of baby boys prepared as gourmet dishes. He is greeted by the Mine Director and Party Secretary and immediately taken to a banquet in his honour. ;2 :Introductory letter from Li Yidou (\"one-pint Li\") to Mo Yan. Li is a PhD candidate in liquor studies at Brewers College in Liquorland, and aspiring author. He includes a short story (Alcohol) that he wrote after watching Red Sorghum, the film adaption of Mo Yan's novel of the same name. ;3 :Mo Yan's reply to Li Yidou. Mo informs Li that he has sent his story to the editors of Citizens' Literature. ;4 :Li Yidou's short story, Alcohol. ;1 :The Mine Director and Party Secretary treat Ding to an expansive feast, and goad him into drinking copious amounts of alcohol. Ding does not hold his alcohol well. Deputy Head Diamond Jin, a Party official with a notorious capacity for drink, also joins them. ;2 :Second letter from Li to Mo, and Li's second story, Meat Boy, which he calls \"grim realism\". Li is now bolder, in his requests to Mo's assistance to become a published author, comparing himself to Lu Xun and saying, \"If you have to host a meal [to get it published], go ahead. If a gift is required, you have my blessing.\" ;3 :Mo's reply to Li, commenting on Meat Boy. ;4 :Li's short story, Meat Boy. One day two parents prepare their baby boy for a special event. The father, Jin Yuanbao, takes the boy on a journey to the Special Purchasing Section of the Culinary Academy in a village across the river. He waits with other parents and sons, perturbed by the presence of a small red demon. His son is eventually assessed by the staff there and judged to be \"top grade\". Jin is paid 2140 yuan. ;1 :The centrepiece of the banquet is revealed, \"Stork Delivering a Son\". It appears to be a whole human baby boy, sitting up in a dish, and smells delicious. Ding draws his gun and accuses his company of cannibalism. Diamond Jin insists the dish is a culinary masterpiece -- a fake child. Ding panics and fires his gun wildly, shooting the baby boy in the head and collapses, drunk. The serving girls bring him sobering-up soup and he recovers somewhat. Diamond Jin explains how the fake boy is created and convinces Ding to eat a lotus root arm. :After further drinking, Ding has an out of body experience where he witnesses the serving girls taking his comatose body to an underground hotel room. While his body is there, a \"scaly-skinned demon\" enters the room and strips his body of useful implements. ;2 :Third letter from Li to Mo. ;3 :Short story Child Prodigy by Li, in the style of \"demonic realism\" (according to Li). It follows the children who were sold at the Special Purchasing Section, and the little demon's attempt to lead them away. ;4 :Mo's reply to Li."
