    "text": " Meg Finn is in trouble. Her mother is dead and her only family is an abusive stepfather who does nothing but watch TV all day. Her stepfather is forced to resign from his job when Meg embarrassed him by showing his work colleagues a video of herself smashing his brand new television that he bought with Meg's mother's engagement ring and all of Meg's life saving . When she is forced to help Belch Brennan, a dim-witted criminal, rob the elderly Lowrie McCall, the attempted burglary ends in disaster. In an attempt to scare Meg, Belch shoots by a gas tank which explodes, killing them both. While Belch is sent straight to hell (his soul merged with that of his vicious dog Raptor by the explosion, making him a half-boy half-dog creature,) Meg's perfect balance between good and evil earns her a chance to redeem herself and get blue in her Aura. She is sent back to earth in order to help Lowrie complete the items on his \"wish list\": a list of things that he feels will correct the many mistakes he made in his life. Meanwhile, Satan has decided that he wants Meg's soul in Hell and Beelzebub is forced to send Belch to recapture Meg and \"make her bad\", making Belch and Elph, the hologram with which he has been equipped, the chief antagonists in the story. The Wish List: 1) Kissy Sissy - Kiss Cicely Ward, (aka Sissy) a popular talk-show granny and one-date girlfriend of Lowrie. 2) Kick a ball over the bar in Croke Park. 3) Burst Ball - Punch a man who bullied Lowrie at school, Punch Brendan Ball. 4) Spit over the Cliffs of Moher. Ultimately, following a confrontation on the edge of the Cliffs of Moher, Belch is destroyed and Meg's final act of holiness - giving her stepfather a new life - gains her entry to Heaven, where she meets her mother again."
