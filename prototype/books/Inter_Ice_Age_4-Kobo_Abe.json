    "text": " Plot elements include submersion of the world caused by melting polar ice, genetic creation of gilled children for the coming underwater age, and a fortune-telling computer predicting the future and advising humans how to deal with it. Because a similar computer in Moscow is being use to make forecasts of a political nature, an institute of a Tokyo professor decides to avoid politics and try to forsee the future of an individual. A man is picked, apparently at random, only to be murdered before he can be programmed, but the computer can still read his mind. The resulting involvements are complicated by a climactic shift - Inter Ice Age 4 - which puts earth under water."
