    "text": " To be a Jedi is to safeguard peace in the galaxy. To be a Jedi is to defend justice against tyranny. To be a Jedi is to rely on the Force. To be a Jedi is to not love or live as normal people do…at whatever the price. Jedi know that love is not meant to be for them. But when Obi-Wan Kenobi and his fellow apprentice Siri approach a very human failing, the reverberations are felt for many years…to when Obi-Wan has an apprentice of his own, Anakin Skywalker, whose secrets will draw Obi-Wan and Siri further into the Clone Wars."
