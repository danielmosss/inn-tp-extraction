Anakin helps Boba repair Slave I, but he's determined to take him in for questioning. It's then that Boba decides to play his information card. He offers the Republic information about Count Dooku in exchange for his freedom. Anakin escorts Boba Fett to the Jedi Temple for a meeting with Palpatine. However, it's there that Boba Fett sees his chance to exact revenge on Mace Windu for the murder of his father, Jango. Boba attempts to kill Mace with several weapons but fails. As Mace is about to kill Boba, Palpatine intervenes and orders them to stop. Boba is spared from the Chancellor's wrath and eventually escorted off the planet."
