At the start of the book, Davina Nuttel, a famous child actress, and Molly Moon's rival, gets kidnapped by Primo Cell, a powerful leader and rich businessman. When Lucy Logan sees the news, she summons Molly because she suspects Primo is behind her abduction and is hypnotizing movie and other types of stars to perform in Primo Cell's ads. And besides, is trying to become the president of United States. Molly travels to Los Angeles, California and finds out her large diamond that she wears around her neck enables her to stop time. She also finds that permanent hypnosis will ensue from stopping time during regular hypnosis of a person. Molly gets help from Sinclair (Primo's stepson), his personal yoga teacher named Forest, and Rocky. Molly finds out that Lucy Logan and Primo Cell are her parents. She also finds Lucy and Primo have been under Cornelius Logan's (Lucy's twin brother) hypnosis for eleven years. The story finally ends when Molly made Cornelius think he was a lamb, through tireless hypnotism and time-stopping. es:Molly Moon detiene el Mundo sv:Molly Moon stannar tiden"
